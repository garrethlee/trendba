Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.  After stocking away an emergency fund you should spend it all on making life long memories (travel, skydiving, learning skills whatever is your thing)\\n\\nNow this is where a LOT of people still early in their FIRE journey are going to shout about \\"compound interest\\" and how I don\'t know what I\'m talking about. But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

For example, with mine you just have to live, work, attend school, or worship in one of the counties they serve. \\n\\nI used to bank with Truist(when it was suntrust) and also Bank of America, but when I was not receiving a payroll auto deposit, they charged me like $5 to $10 bucks for monthly acct maintenence...or I had to maintain too high of a min balance then I was capable of(which hasn\'t been the case with my credit union).  $5 or $10 per month may not seem like a lot but with no steady income coming in from sales in the beginning, and every penny counting, it didn\'t make sense to throw away over $100 per yr on maintenamce fees.\\n\\n Best wishes with your business!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131323s","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/131323s/best_bank_for_a_business_not_making_profit_yet/ji0lmwi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656903,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Entrepreneur","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"b8a642f55bc90dd7b884d4453b6df5e16fab9138","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:43"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c27eae00-3feb-11e8-8a87-0e782b3ca234","id":"ji0lmm0","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"BleonS04","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_69mdxo7n","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks\xf0\x9f\xa4\x9d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbcMavericks: having a fan as a coach","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Mavs4","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":dal-4:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/w4u060v9s4r81_t5_2qo4s/dal-4"},{"e":"text","t":" Mavericks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1309lx8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1309lx8/bontemps_erik_spoelstra_puts_bam_adebayo_on_the/ji0lmm0/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":dal-4: Mavericks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656898,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"7158097ab31dbbf00ad0ba90d803abe220c6ff65","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"bjj","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lmbo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"livejiujitsu","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_thifupq5","all_awardings":[],"body":"You are right, there is no hype and the only people that wear it get paid a couple bucks to do it.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gvkf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/bjj/comments/131gvkf/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_levelxblack/ji0lmbo/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656893,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/bjj","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656908,"updated_utc":1682656909,"body_sha1":"19ac94b22a0bcaf756b67e1ae6e21c08b87a95f3","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_3az7x","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"cyberpunkgame","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lkwz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"iamfanboytoo","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1eg2tpv","all_awardings":[],"body":"It plays fine on a PS4;

Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you.

The reason you can\'t book a discovery flight out of downtown St. Paul airport itself is because there is no longer a flight school based there.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130tisy","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/saintpaul/comments/130tisy/saint_paul_downtown_airport/ji0na22/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657961,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/saintpaul","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657976,"updated_utc":1682657976,"body_sha1":"1c6e75b218cd20416e0a80b739fac708dad0d6a8","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:59:21"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s53a","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Mavericks","author_flair_template_id":"dc933352-96e0-11eb-ad74-0e3586522b27","id":"ji0n9ty","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"aaronunderwater","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9uu7e","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\'m late but I have a good one:\\n\\n1 Bucks\\n\\n2 Wesley Mathew and salary filler\\n\\n3 ......

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35.

Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

For example, with mine you just have to live, work, attend school, or worship in one of the counties they serve. \\n\\nI used to bank with Truist(when it was suntrust) and also Bank of America, but when I was not receiving a payroll auto deposit, they charged me like $5 to $10 bucks for monthly acct maintenence...or I had to maintain too high of a min balance then I was capable of(which hasn\'t been the case with my credit union).  $5 or $10 per month may not seem like a lot but with no steady income coming in from sales in the beginning, and every penny counting, it didn\'t make sense to throw away over $100 per yr on maintenamce fees.\\n\\n Best wishes with your business!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131323s","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/131323s/best_bank_for_a_business_not_making_profit_yet/ji0lmwi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656903,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Entrepreneur","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"b8a642f55bc90dd7b884d4453b6df5e16fab9138","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:43"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c27eae00-3feb-11e8-8a87-0e782b3ca234","id":"ji0lmm0","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"BleonS04","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_69mdxo7n","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks\xf0\x9f\xa4\x9d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbcMavericks: having a fan as a coach","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Mavs4","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":dal-4:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/w4u060v9s4r81_t5_2qo4s/dal-4"},{"e":"text","t":" Mavericks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1309lx8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1309lx8/bontemps_erik_spoelstra_puts_bam_adebayo_on_the/ji0lmm0/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":dal-4: Mavericks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656898,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"7158097ab31dbbf00ad0ba90d803abe220c6ff65","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"bjj","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lmbo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"livejiujitsu","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_thifupq5","all_awardings":[],"body":"You are right, there is no hype and the only people that wear it get paid a couple bucks to do it.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gvkf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/bjj/comments/131gvkf/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_levelxblack/ji0lmbo/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656893,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/bjj","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656908,"updated_utc":1682656909,"body_sha1":"19ac94b22a0bcaf756b67e1ae6e21c08b87a95f3","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_3az7x","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"cyberpunkgame","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lkwz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"iamfanboytoo","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1eg2tpv","all_awardings":[],"body":"It plays fine on a PS4;

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

For example, with mine you just have to live, work, attend school, or worship in one of the counties they serve. \\n\\nI used to bank with Truist(when it was suntrust) and also Bank of America, but when I was not receiving a payroll auto deposit, they charged me like $5 to $10 bucks for monthly acct maintenence...or I had to maintain too high of a min balance then I was capable of(which hasn\'t been the case with my credit union).  $5 or $10 per month may not seem like a lot but with no steady income coming in from sales in the beginning, and every penny counting, it didn\'t make sense to throw away over $100 per yr on maintenamce fees.\\n\\n Best wishes with your business!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131323s","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/131323s/best_bank_for_a_business_not_making_profit_yet/ji0lmwi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656903,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Entrepreneur","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"b8a642f55bc90dd7b884d4453b6df5e16fab9138","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:43"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c27eae00-3feb-11e8-8a87-0e782b3ca234","id":"ji0lmm0","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"BleonS04","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_69mdxo7n","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks\xf0\x9f\xa4\x9d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbcMavericks: having a fan as a coach","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Mavs4","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":dal-4:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/w4u060v9s4r81_t5_2qo4s/dal-4"},{"e":"text","t":" Mavericks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1309lx8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1309lx8/bontemps_erik_spoelstra_puts_bam_adebayo_on_the/ji0lmm0/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":dal-4: Mavericks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656898,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"7158097ab31dbbf00ad0ba90d803abe220c6ff65","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"bjj","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lmbo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"livejiujitsu","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_thifupq5","all_awardings":[],"body":"You are right, there is no hype and the only people that wear it get paid a couple bucks to do it.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gvkf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/bjj/comments/131gvkf/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_levelxblack/ji0lmbo/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656893,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/bjj","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656908,"updated_utc":1682656909,"body_sha1":"19ac94b22a0bcaf756b67e1ae6e21c08b87a95f3","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_3az7x","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"cyberpunkgame","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lkwz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"iamfanboytoo","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1eg2tpv","all_awardings":[],"body":"It plays fine on a PS4;

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

Very easy for you to do, as you are ONE person. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any desire to go to their properties, communication channels, etc. \\n\\n(2) THEY are a huge organization. Very unstructured and not very good at keeping data private (Think of all the paper ward lists floating around out there as well as electronic ones). Or the newest set of missionaries to come through the area. They are completely open to making mistakes which could easily be scene as continued and orchestrated harassment of you and/or family. \\n\\n(3) Find a MAJOR law firm or possibly contact the ACLU. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, but I firmly believe they have crossed a legal line here. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even contact their law firm back? Seriously- this stinks if fish on so many levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure myself and many other EXMOs would kick in a few bucks - collectively we could give you a good legal $ war chest. \\n\\n(4) Have your lawyer basically write a letter back stating every person from the prophet-Q12 - Q70 - Church Office Building - Stake Presidency - Bishoprics - High Counsel - Mission President- Missionaries - Ministering Members (home and visiting teachers), Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Relief Society Members and local ward members that THEY must cease and desist initiating ANY contact with you OR THEY will face lawful and legal action for continued harassment and emotional trauma to you and/or your family. \\n\\nAll you have to do is sit back and wait for them to make contact. Surely with their constant turnover and very porous record keeping infrastructure they are almost guaranteed to mess up. Second counselor of Relief Society accidentally used old paper ward list and calls you. Missionaries go knocking doors and call upon you. \\n\\nI think you, and possibly everyone else who got this letter could have a harassment case easily in the near future for violating your personal and religious rights.

Assuming you start your four year university timer as soon as you turn 18 you\'re now a 21 year old, you probably have debt to pay off, your professional/academic credentials are in their infancy, your family/home life still probably isn\'t fully settled, and running for office means you\'re staring down the barrel of taking a very large amount of time off from work to campaign.\\n\\nMost local/state offices pay terrible salaries and require a heavy time commitment so unless you\'ve got a trust fund or a grift lined up you\'ll need to find some way to get your finances in order while beefing up your resume.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you decide to become a lawyer since that\'s the most accessible profession to get into politics- studying full-time that\'s three more years (seven years of college total) so now you\'re 24 years old, more likely 25 or 26. Any hypothetical student debt is now much worse than it had been and there\'s decent odds you\'ve got a spouse or child that you\'re going to have to spend time/money on. Also you now need to do all sorts of time-consuming stuff in the name of your career.\\n\\nLet\'s assume you turn out to be a pretty successful lawyer and you get your stuff sorted out enough that you\'re feeling confident enough to go for city council or county commissioner by 35. You won after taking time away from your job and family for at least one year. Congratulations, you\'re now at the absolute bottom rung of the hierarchy and you have to survive a whole slate of people with the same office as you who gave more money/experience/influence than you.\\n\\nIt turns out you\'re a rising star and after one four year term you escape that local office trap and go into the state legislature at the age of 39-41. Here you\'re even less individually powerful, but you can network with the bigwigs in your state and your influence over others is growing. You are the protagonist of this hypothetical so you\'re lucky enough to quickly get scouted to run for US Congress or for a statewide office, and you end up winning!\\n\\nYou have now through implausible luck elbowed your way past an ocean of rivals up the ladder to what is in the grand scheme of the country only an upper-midranked office when you\'re around your mid forties. Realistically you probably didn\'t just keep climbing that steadily and you probably didn\'t start running for office that young so more realistically you\'re in your fifties or sixties.\\n\\nYou run for reelection and start getting seniority to become one of the bigwigs, and oh- what happened, why are you in your seventies now? By this point you\'ve dedicated your entire adult life to getting to where you are and you\'ve got so much going on so you\'re not going to get out of the way when you\'re finally able to make a difference, and the young bucks can\'t easily oust such a successful elder as you now that you\'ve had a chance to entrench yourself in your office.\\n\\nYou finally start to make some headway on the things you\'re passionate about and the whole country is starting to pay attention to you, and... oh, they\'re just looking at you because your deteriorating health represents a threat to democracy if the other side takes advantage when you\'re unavailable to do your job.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130y9sj","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/130y9sj/nikki_maga_representative_with_inside_information/ji0n3rz/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657845,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/WhitePeopleTwitter","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657860,"updated_utc":1682657861,"body_sha1":"b35c0973a1436e56999bcf864772cdd5e74f28e2","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"2007scape","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n1gm","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PusHVongola","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443134206,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_g4s43","all_awardings":[],"body":"They buy the accounts from Venezuelans for like 80 bucks or ~275-300m.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130mwkm","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/130mwkm/theres_a_total_of_9_of_them_a_couple_on_the_same/ji0n1gm/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657804,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/2007scape","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657816,"updated_utc":1682657817,"body_sha1":"32495001c01ca35e9ec4324bb15acce4d68e6a22","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:44"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qx4j","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Fire","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n0zi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Earth2Andy","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_n0jm0","all_awardings":[],"body":"This is always an unpopular opinion in this community, but it\'s true.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*IF\\\\* you have reason to expect you\'re going to have a solid career and climb the corporate ladder and get promoted a few times, then honestly saving anything between the ages of 18 and 24 is pretty much pointless.

But take it from someone who is pretty much at the end of the FIRE journey - small amounts compounded are still small amounts and become rounding errors in your final FIRE number.  The real bulk of FIRE savings comes later in your career as long as your salary keeps growing and you keep expenses under control.\\n\\nIF you\'ve chosen a career that provides reasonable salary growth expectations as you gain years of experience, then it\'s quite likely, later in life, you\'ll end up with a salary paying 5x times what your starting salary pays.  Assuming you can avoid lifestyle creep, the amount of money you\'ll be able to save later in your career will dwarf any minor savings from your early 20s.  The savings from your first couple of years out of collage will be an absolute rounding error in your final number and skipping them will have at most a minor on your retirement \\n\\nDon\'t spend your early 20s scrimping and saving, just to give an older, richer version of yourself a few extra bucks they won\'t care about.  Instead focus on giving that version of you epic memories they can enjoy for decades.\\n\\nI\'m sure this will get a ton of down-votes and people ranting about how a $1 saved at 20 is worth $2 at 30, but those people are forgetting that between inflation and salary growth in your career that it\'s significantly easier to save $2 at 30 than $1 at 20, while much harder to build life long memories.\\n\\nNote this advice only appllies from 18-24.  25 onwards you best be saving hard.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1311qcn","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Fire/comments/1311qcn/what_did_you_do_from_ages_1830/ji0n0zi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657795,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Fire","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657809,"updated_utc":1682657810,"body_sha1":"95aa1c77468573438a0d21f654682347d1d6adce","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:56:35"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2td2i","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nbacirclejerk","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mxvi","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"VisitTheWind","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448173497,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5mmxfbp2","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks in 6","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131g15v","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/nbacirclejerk/comments/131g15v/giannis_explaining_how_going_14_as_a_1_seed/ji0mxvi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657740,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nbacirclejerk","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657757,"updated_utc":1682657758,"body_sha1":"1251db50b3a5b50560c7b972f8afa4e79330babe","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:55:40"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s8tk","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"heat","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mx7q","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Proof-Cry-4956","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42440114520,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d2j2gbas","all_awardings":[],"body":"The big Greek fuck ain\xe2\x80\x99t shit.

For example, with mine you just have to live, work, attend school, or worship in one of the counties they serve. \\n\\nI used to bank with Truist(when it was suntrust) and also Bank of America, but when I was not receiving a payroll auto deposit, they charged me like $5 to $10 bucks for monthly acct maintenence...or I had to maintain too high of a min balance then I was capable of(which hasn\'t been the case with my credit union).  $5 or $10 per month may not seem like a lot but with no steady income coming in from sales in the beginning, and every penny counting, it didn\'t make sense to throw away over $100 per yr on maintenamce fees.\\n\\n Best wishes with your business!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131323s","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/131323s/best_bank_for_a_business_not_making_profit_yet/ji0lmwi/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656903,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Entrepreneur","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"b8a642f55bc90dd7b884d4453b6df5e16fab9138","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:43"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c27eae00-3feb-11e8-8a87-0e782b3ca234","id":"ji0lmm0","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"BleonS04","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_69mdxo7n","all_awardings":[],"body":"Bucks\xf0\x9f\xa4\x9d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbcMavericks: having a fan as a coach","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Mavs4","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":dal-4:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/w4u060v9s4r81_t5_2qo4s/dal-4"},{"e":"text","t":" Mavericks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1309lx8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1309lx8/bontemps_erik_spoelstra_puts_bam_adebayo_on_the/ji0lmm0/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":dal-4: Mavericks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656898,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656916,"updated_utc":1682656917,"body_sha1":"7158097ab31dbbf00ad0ba90d803abe220c6ff65","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qn02","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"bjj","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lmbo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"livejiujitsu","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_thifupq5","all_awardings":[],"body":"You are right, there is no hype and the only people that wear it get paid a couple bucks to do it.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gvkf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/bjj/comments/131gvkf/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_levelxblack/ji0lmbo/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656893,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/bjj","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656908,"updated_utc":1682656909,"body_sha1":"19ac94b22a0bcaf756b67e1ae6e21c08b87a95f3","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:41:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_3az7x","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"cyberpunkgame","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lkwz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"iamfanboytoo","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1eg2tpv","all_awardings":[],"body":"It plays fine on a PS4;
