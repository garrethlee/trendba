Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.  Its a common set up, 1 bike warlock to do the ritual, and then a pair of foot ones to do quicken the bike warlock back out of los.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130lomp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Eldar/comments/130lomp/aoc_ynnari_list/ji0nkqp/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658162,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Eldar","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658178,"updated_utc":1682658178,"body_sha1":"04173c245000ff4eae16c6f94484672e4c7b8535","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:42"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nizg","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PlzDmMe","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448342558,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4r2ov7vc","all_awardings":[],"body":"As a hawks fan, seeing that from 30 feet away\xe2\x80\xa6.man is a superstar.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131hmrf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131hmrf/tatum_i_know_the_narrative_of_we_was_supposed_to/ji0nizg/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658129,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658141,"updated_utc":1682658142,"body_sha1":"4869c454606315c67ca3ddf2f4db698286d3c229","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:09"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2sgwl","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"AtlantaHawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nff6","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"thelastfrontier189","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448289845,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1sybgfe4","all_awardings":[],"body":"Trae shot poorly the first half of last game.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.  Its a common set up, 1 bike warlock to do the ritual, and then a pair of foot ones to do quicken the bike warlock back out of los.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130lomp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Eldar/comments/130lomp/aoc_ynnari_list/ji0nkqp/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658162,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Eldar","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658178,"updated_utc":1682658178,"body_sha1":"04173c245000ff4eae16c6f94484672e4c7b8535","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:42"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nizg","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PlzDmMe","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448342558,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4r2ov7vc","all_awardings":[],"body":"As a hawks fan, seeing that from 30 feet away\xe2\x80\xa6.man is a superstar.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131hmrf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131hmrf/tatum_i_know_the_narrative_of_we_was_supposed_to/ji0nizg/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658129,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658141,"updated_utc":1682658142,"body_sha1":"4869c454606315c67ca3ddf2f4db698286d3c229","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:09"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2sgwl","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"AtlantaHawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nff6","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"thelastfrontier189","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448289845,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1sybgfe4","all_awardings":[],"body":"Trae shot poorly the first half of last game.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.  Its a common set up, 1 bike warlock to do the ritual, and then a pair of foot ones to do quicken the bike warlock back out of los.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130lomp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Eldar/comments/130lomp/aoc_ynnari_list/ji0nkqp/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658162,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Eldar","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658178,"updated_utc":1682658178,"body_sha1":"04173c245000ff4eae16c6f94484672e4c7b8535","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:42"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nizg","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PlzDmMe","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448342558,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4r2ov7vc","all_awardings":[],"body":"As a hawks fan, seeing that from 30 feet away\xe2\x80\xa6.man is a superstar.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131hmrf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131hmrf/tatum_i_know_the_narrative_of_we_was_supposed_to/ji0nizg/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658129,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658141,"updated_utc":1682658142,"body_sha1":"4869c454606315c67ca3ddf2f4db698286d3c229","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:09"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2sgwl","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"AtlantaHawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nff6","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"thelastfrontier189","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448289845,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1sybgfe4","all_awardings":[],"body":"Trae shot poorly the first half of last game.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.  Its a common set up, 1 bike warlock to do the ritual, and then a pair of foot ones to do quicken the bike warlock back out of los.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130lomp","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Eldar/comments/130lomp/aoc_ynnari_list/ji0nkqp/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658162,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Eldar","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658178,"updated_utc":1682658178,"body_sha1":"04173c245000ff4eae16c6f94484672e4c7b8535","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:42"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nizg","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PlzDmMe","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448342558,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_4r2ov7vc","all_awardings":[],"body":"As a hawks fan, seeing that from 30 feet away\xe2\x80\xa6.man is a superstar.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131hmrf","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131hmrf/tatum_i_know_the_narrative_of_we_was_supposed_to/ji0nizg/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682658129,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682658141,"updated_utc":1682658142,"body_sha1":"4869c454606315c67ca3ddf2f4db698286d3c229","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 05:02:09"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2sgwl","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"AtlantaHawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0nff6","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"thelastfrontier189","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448289845,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1sybgfe4","all_awardings":[],"body":"Trae shot poorly the first half of last game.

Doc should\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to come up with a better pr speak nothing answer, but honestly how do you answer \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think Ben Simmons can be an nba caliber pg\xe2\x80\x9d after that historically bad performance and multiple other playoff debacles? Anything with \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d in it would have been an obvious lie or made doc look like an idiot. Even then all he said was \xe2\x80\x9cidk the answer to that right now.\xe2\x80\x9d That is not a reasonable excuse to pull what Ben did after. And then months later Simmons goes on jj\xe2\x80\x99s podcast with zero self awareness about the whole thing and clearly believes none of it was his fault. \\n\\nThere were reports of signs of Ben being lazy, ignoring coaching, and quitting on the team all the way back to LSU. If anything all the coddling hurt him, he needed someone to get in his face and get him to accept reality. If he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle that at least it would\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten him off the team earlier.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130ygtv","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/130ygtv/jeff_teague_talks_about_the_infamous_minnesota/ji0n7e9/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657911,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657925,"updated_utc":1682657926,"body_sha1":"29f4b728578466f4ff6b278ae0c92f83623ef009","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:58:31"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ryle","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Seahawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0n2aq","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Wayeb","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_10t2w9","all_awardings":[],"body":"Super happy with the hawks draft at the end of the day.\\n\\nBUT that eagles draft has me a bit envious.

Damage has gone up, so expensive infantry is generally not a good idea.  Even with the high T, these things will die.  Depending on who you fight however, and with enough buffs they can still be good but you really need to put a lot into buffs, Im talking multiple warlocks type thing.  The problem is an aspect squad does similar damage to a wraith squad.  For half the points.  Generally its better to use careful positioning out of los, or battle focus with the aspects then it is to try to tank damage.  If we had some defensive strats other then the -1 to hit this might be different but....\\n\\nThe Yncarne is definitely worth bringing period.  If you do I suggest some cheap vypers or war walkers, whatever you have slots for.  The idea is if one dies, then surprise Yncarne!  It changes the way the game is played due to there possibly being a bad result for the enemy kiling a unit.  Just start it on the board out of los and try to bring the Yncarne in during your foes turn, after they dont have much that can kill it.\\n\\nAgain, the Yncarne is the whole reason some people got into Ynnari.  That said at 1k pts, it might be hard to fit it in there.  Still good to have if you play more then 1k though.\\n\\nThe only thing I would replace is the nightspinner.  If you want lots of shots, go for warp spiders.  You could take a squad of 5, for less then the nightspinner to put the points somewhere else.  Swooping hawks might work as well, as they are longer range and just...well never die.  They are kinda high pts price and both the mentioned aspects dont have new models, only the poor quality resin.  Might be worth getting older models from miniswap or ebay.\\n\\nWhen you go up in points, other hq include an archon (for court of the archon, they are tough for the points and the shield of Ynead makes them really hard to kill off).  A shadowseer is also good for mortal wounds.  Troupes are good for an troop unit, but you would want a second ranger for doing secondary missions before that.  Id also consider more melee units like shining spears and striking scorpions.  That said, with what you had is pretty good at start.  No where near as much issues as most lists I see.  Also this is for tourney style list, if you play with just friends and really like a unit, feel free to use it.  It will not be optimal, but you dont always want that when playing vs friends.\\n\\nOh psychic powers.  Protect/jinx is good on the warlock.  Are you planning ot do warp ritual secondary?  Its worth thinking about secondaries for larger games.  In 1k pts you can still win just wiping out the enemy quick on the smaller board.  But in larger games your gonna want to plan secondaries out ahead of time.  Rangers are really good for secondaries, thats why you still see them in lists even after we dont have to take unperforming troops in our lists with AoO.  The reason I mention this is quicken can be used to protect your warlock if you would like to do warp ritual.
