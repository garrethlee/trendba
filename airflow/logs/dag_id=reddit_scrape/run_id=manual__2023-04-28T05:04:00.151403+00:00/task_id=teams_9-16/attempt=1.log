I\xe2\x80\x99ve come across gang bangers that age. \\nNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit more to it than just entering someone\xe2\x80\x99s name into a registry. You actually need to prove someone is gang affiliated.\\n\\n2, No he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. First off, you can\xe2\x80\x99t really own a gun in California/LA. It\xe2\x80\x99s near impossible for a law abiding citizen to get a gun, let alone a prohibited person such as this individual in the video. So no, he has no 2nd amendment right. Nor would that supersede the safety of others.\\n\\n3, Yes, he is prohibited from owning a gun. He was arrested for multiple counts of robbery and it\xe2\x80\x99s still an ongoing case as of now. \\n\\n4, You would be the low IQ type to call police \xe2\x80\x9cpigs\xe2\x80\x9d. Grow up. \\n\\n5, I already explained to you that it cannot be both a negligent discharge and attempted murder. One is a purposeful action, while the other is not. The fact you still don\xe2\x80\x99t know this, shows how ignorant you are.\\n\\n6, I did not train this officer. But shooting from vehicles is a totally sound tactic. If you have to shoot, you have to shoot. Sometimes that means shooting from a compromised less ideal position. He did identify the threat. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it clearly in the video, but close up pictures of the butane lighter shows that it looks extremely similar to a firearm. Especially if you were in the heat of the moment. He did check his backdrop. \\n\\n7, Nice race baiting. Just to let you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s a myth too. There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a racially motivated police shooting in years. The overwhelming majority of shootings are justified, and despite what the media tells you, police don\xe2\x80\x99t go around killing brown people Willy nilly. This guy isn\xe2\x80\x99t a criminal because he\xe2\x80\x99s brown. He\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal because he\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal.\\n\\n8, Telling me I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be near firearms when you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a negligent discharge is, is absolutely priceless. You really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry kiddo, we all start somewhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s ok to know absolutely nothing.

Not as dire as what I\'ve seen images of when it comes to the ghetto parts of major American cities but relative to our own standards it\'s pretty bad. I know, I live in it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst you\'re about an hour\'s commute away from the \\"Sydney\\" that foreigners know of. The harbour, beaches, shops, restaurants, parks and just overall culture, excitement and visual appeal that the eastern and northern parts of the city have to offer. Of course you can live in these areas too - if you\'re a millionaire. But what about those who are doing most of the real work in this otherwise fine city?\\n\\nThey/we are shoved into the outer western and south-western parts of the city. Hour to the CBD (and the better job opportunities that only exist there). Hour (or more) to any decent beaches and you\'re gonna be sitting in fucking traffic either trip. There\'s trains too but often you\'ll still have to drive to the stations and there seems to be track work or something going on every month so relying on public transport can really fuck up your day sometimes. There\'s less in terms of nice shops or restaurants around, I\'ve seen some come and go - they\'re usually ended because of lack of business catering to the markets out here who many of which actually do make plenty of money but would rather spend it on gambling or alcohol instead. Or having a fourth child they can\'t afford. Lots of drugs out here. I\'ve lived next to drug users and dealers more times than anyone in a not-shit part of the city ever would in a lifetime. They can be real neighbours from hell. \\n\\nSpeaking of hell the weather is literally worse the further you get from the coastal suburbs. Few years back it got to 49 Celsius in some parts of western Sydney. For American readers like yourself that\'s around 120F! Odds are it never got that hot in this part of this country before when it was still forested, but urban sprawl like in the picture above and your typical \\"westie\'s\\" *remarkable* hatred of trees on their property means the heat island effect really doubles down on the summer temperatures. Whereas in the suburbs closer to the city and beaches (more expensive) have *much* more tolerable summers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could go on and on but the simple fact is north and east Sydney is the \\"good\\" Sydney and south and west is the \\"crap\\" Sydney.

You are turning your brain off to too much here.\\n\\nOne of the other posters has it mostly right. Assuming you do not have a deficient roof install, which I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out categorically because of how shoddy the ceiling install is, root cause is interior humidity.\\n\\nThere are two probable sources:\\n1) the ground below the concrete slab\\n2) water that comes in frozen to a vehicle as ice and then thaws and soaks into the floor slab\\n\\nThe first thing to know is that if you bought this house, it should have a warranty, and this issue should be warrantable until you start doing the work yourself. This is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal thing with every house\xe2\x80\x9d, this is grossly deficient design and construction. In other words, we knew how to avoid this kind of stuff reliably by the tail end of the 1970s if not earlier.\\n\\nIf you replace the assembly with the same assembly, the same thing will happen. Heat, fans, and/or lack thereof are not your problem. This is a garage. The mould is not going to kill you any more quickly than residual exhaust fumes. If you are going to replace the drywall, the reason to do so would be to get rid of the food source for the mould (wood fibres that make up the paper face) FOR GOOD.\\n\\nAnother poster mentioned the solution was OSB. OSB is made of\xe2\x80\xa6. wood fibre. OSB is not a permissible wall treatment for an attached garage unless applied IN CONJUNCTION WITH a continuous layer of drywall. So don\xe2\x80\x99t use OSB. If you wanted to use glass mat sheathing like you can see on commercial exteriors (e.g. SecuRock, GlasRoc, DensGlass Gold, etc.) \xe2\x80\xa6. it exists\xe2\x80\xa6. it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper than Mold Tough\xe2\x80\xa6 you could do it and finish it like regular drywall and paint over it. I have used it for painted ceilings where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the roofing install a whole lot. But until you figure out how to stop getting new mold growth with the existing assembly, just hold your horses and figure out the root cause.\\n\\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the facts:\\n\\n1. Mold needs food, water, heat to grow\\n2. Parking a wet car inside is sometimes desirable\\n3. The best thing for any building is always to just keep the wet stuff out of it\\n4. We assume it\xe2\x80\x99s of critical importance to \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to use the garage we paid for\xe2\x80\x9d and that means water is going to come in as snow / rain / puddle water\\n5. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want water to adsorb into the floor because it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the floor and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to warm the floor enough to get it back out via evaporation (at least on our schedule)\\n6. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have floor drains because nobody puts those in residential garages even though they are critically important in cold climates where cars get snow on them\\n7. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a good vapour barrier under our slab, but we assume there is something preventing the wicking of bulk ground moisture from wicking up into the floor from below\\n8. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend more money than we have to - if the ceiling weren\xe2\x80\x99t showing mould spots, we would be worried about other things than starting a construction project in the garage\\n\\nIf that checks out:\\n\\n1. You want a siloxane coating for the garage floor to inhibit the adsorption of liquid water into the floor slab where it is harder to control\\n2. You want a lot of heat at/near the floor blowing across the floor at floor height\\n3. You want exhaust from at ceiling height\\n4. You want a MORE airtight ceiling, not a less airtight ceiling - and you want airtight walls - and you need to get the bottom-of-wall airtight somehow too - see discussion below.\\n5. The exhausted air needs to come from somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6. you do not want it coming from the house proper - just believe me on that one lest I launch into a huge sub-discussion.\\n6. Replacing finishes without addressing root causes in proportion to the massive amount of moisture a car can bring into a garage each day is going to be a frustrating exercise because youm\xe2\x80\x99ll do it more than once and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the damage just moves to another location that\xe2\x80\x99s more expensive to fix, like rot in the roof sheathing itself or mould on hidden framing members instead of on visible surfaces.\\n\\nAll of this is a lot more expensive than getting a lawyer to get your builder to get a design professional in to design an appropriate fix for the root causes and make the builder pay for sorting everything out. Whether or not you pursue that route is a matter of how financially successful the builder is and your taste in life\xe2\x80\xa6. I am not an expert on new home warranty / title insurance stuff.\\n\\nRe: airtight ceilings, walls, etc.:\\n\\n1. You have a moisture problem\\n2. The moisture is coming from the interior of the garage and/or from the soil below the slab\\n3. The moisture is getting to the ceiling in sufficient quantity to get the paper facer wet enough for long enough that mold is growing\\n4. The AIR is the only vector by which moisture could be moving to the ceiling - point being: air can move a lot of moisture.\\n\\nWhat is probably happening in the specific areas that have the worst mold growth is that there is insufficient airtightness at the ceiling plane (because the drywall is not finished) to STOP the interior humid air from bypassing the relatively warm ceiling (it must be warm at least seasonally - I would guess more often than seasonally - after all it\xe2\x80\x99s growing mold) and reaching the much, much colder underside of the roof sheathing (i.e. OSB or plywood decking roof decking) where it\xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it\xe2\x80\xa6. turns into water droplets and falls onto the top surface of the drywall board right above the mold growth.\\n\\nSo in other words you have a rainforest microclimate in your garage ceiling and part of the answer is that you need to keep the moisture that evaporates off the car and off the floor after falling off the car in the room as water-vapour-laden-air and exhaust it mechanically (with a fan) to the exterior of the building\xe2\x80\xa6.. or if you have money and want the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d option just aggressively dehumidify the room 24/7.\\n\\nIf you have any non-high efficiency appliances (water heater, furnace) or a gas range\xe2\x80\xa6. or if you have a forced air outlet connecting the garage to the main furnace for the house\xe2\x80\xa6. you have to be extremely careful about putting new fans anywhere\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x9csucking smoke down the chimney\xe2\x80\x9d type stuff can and does happen.\\n\\nA lot of construction guys have an anti-intellectual complex where the answer is that \xe2\x80\x9ccode is stupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuildings need to breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. This is not code (it\xe2\x80\x99s also perhaps not far from being code with some adjustments) and buildings don\xe2\x80\x99t need to breathe, they need to be ventilated appropriately for occupant health (which means not too little, otherwise the occupants run out of oxygen, and not too much, otherwise the occupants turn into raisins) and to control moisture loads and other loads (like water dripping off a car that was just outside or someone taking a shower).\\n\\nMore than you asked for in a more assured tone than you asked for\xe2\x80\xa6. good luck. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get screwed by people who think they know everything there is to know about buildings because they know one or two trades pretty well. I know zero trades really well and every trade well enough to know when someone else is overconfident or is not speaking impartially. Your particular problem is something that has always and will always be a builder-level issue because no subtrade can guarantee it won\xe2\x80\x99t materialize based only on the quality of their specific part of the build.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_12z0u3n","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Winnipeg/comments/12z0u3n/mold_in_new_garage_help/ji0lo0s/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656923,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Winnipeg","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656937,"updated_utc":1682656938,"body_sha1":"dc1b78c02814ab13008cbbe578f14bfc564d20d3","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:42:03"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhkh","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"gardening","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lm0a","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"NootHawg","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9ul8oh6m","all_awardings":[],"body":"When you think about it this could be everywhere in the US in no time with very minimal modifications or reinforcements to the structure.

I will explain my logic here as well. \\n\\n***1) What do you need to keep running. How much power do you actually need to exist comfortably in the home. ***\\n\\nMy logic here is that a oversized generator will burn through fuel at a faster rate than one that is smaller. Since you do not have natural gas, you are limited in run time to what you can store.\\n\\nI have an electric dryer, Propane stove, propane hot water, and a heat pump (with propane backup) in my home.\\n\\nMy energy usage varies significantly. The numbers here do not include my heat pump at all, since that is metered separately but do include my furnace fan. \\n\\nFor an example on 4/23/2023 I used 49.35 KW of power,  the bulk of which was my dryer (I washed my feather pillows that take hours to dry in there) My hourly range was .62 kWh - 3.55 kWh. This would not include my heating needs on this day.\\nFor the most part, my home I draw less than 1,000 watts, with some fairly large peaks (like my well pump which pulls 16 amps @ 120v.)\\n\\nWhat i found is that I can run my home just fine off my little 2500 Peak, 2200 running generator. However, if I want to run the AC, or the well pump, or run the microwave, with anything else running but lighting it can\xe2\x80\x99t power that load. However the vast majority of the time that runs just fine and consumes very little fuel. I should say, I can run my well, with no load anywhere else on this little guy if I plug the well into the generator directly (Keep in mind I have a 120v well pump) and the guy that owned the house before made his own disconnect by taking a extension plug ends and using those to make it work like a normal outlet, super janky but I guess it could come in handy. I will fix this when I rebuild the pump house this summer. \\n\\n***2) How long do you need to run for without going out to refuel, how long are you willing to store the fuel, and general situations around the use.\\n\\nSo here, when I get a storm that takes the power out, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty reasonable to have a better idea when power will be restored, gas stations that are open, etc in a few hours but for sure less than a day. Because of this, I keep enough gas for the generator on the property for 24 hours to run the large one, or about 48 hours of the smaller one. Realistically I can run the small one all but for a few hours a day to shower and do laundry.\\n\\nWhen you are expecting a hurricane I imagine it could take longer than that to resupply so I suspect you would want a longer term storage to provide you time to find out a way to reply your fuel. I suspect this is a few days for you?\\n\\nNow let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about actually starting the generator. When I have a storm during the summer usually it\xe2\x80\x99s short lived where I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go outside. For this I have a UPS that powers my internet, a flashlight, and a cord that I can plug the iPad into watch local over the air tv or steam the local news to find out when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to exit the home to turn it on. We\xe2\x80\x99re usually talking about 30 min to an hour max. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a snow storm this is not a concern.\\n\\nDuring the peak of the hurricane are you going to want to go outside to start one or is a standby solution better? Are you going to be able to go outside to refill it?\\n\\nMy guess is no, and a propane generator that\xe2\x80\x99s connected to a large propane tank may be the way to go. However running off that for a month sounds very expensive. A whole house generator could burn through a 500 gallon tank (so 400 gallons usable) in 4 days pretty easily. I paid 2.15 a gallon and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay 800+ for a few days of power. At $4 a gallon 4 days would cost me less than 300 without being mindful about how I used it.\\n\\nThen you got to think about how long can you run it without servicing? I can run my big one for 100 hours on synthetic oil before needing to change it. So a little over 4 days. Splitting that into half of each I can go 8 days. My older little generator though I just do it once in the spring and once in the winter. It\xe2\x80\x99s old.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13055o8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/preppers/comments/13055o8/looking_to_get_a_whole_house_generator/ji0lgui/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656797,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/preppers","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656813,"updated_utc":1682656814,"body_sha1":"fb69b213450b33ccdb9aec3c7ab808d6e01c73de","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:39:57"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u82k","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"askportland","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lgnx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"birdVVoman","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1uxevea4","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\xe2\x80\x99m from Oklahoma and have lived in the PNW 20 years.

I know, I live in it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst you\'re about an hour\'s commute away from the \\"Sydney\\" that foreigners know of. The harbour, beaches, shops, restaurants, parks and just overall culture, excitement and visual appeal that the eastern and northern parts of the city have to offer. Of course you can live in these areas too - if you\'re a millionaire. But what about those who are doing most of the real work in this otherwise fine city?\\n\\nThey/we are shoved into the outer western and south-western parts of the city. Hour to the CBD (and the better job opportunities that only exist there). Hour (or more) to any decent beaches and you\'re gonna be sitting in fucking traffic either trip. There\'s trains too but often you\'ll still have to drive to the stations and there seems to be track work or something going on every month so relying on public transport can really fuck up your day sometimes. There\'s less in terms of nice shops or restaurants around, I\'ve seen some come and go - they\'re usually ended because of lack of business catering to the markets out here who many of which actually do make plenty of money but would rather spend it on gambling or alcohol instead. Or having a fourth child they can\'t afford. Lots of drugs out here. I\'ve lived next to drug users and dealers more times than anyone in a not-shit part of the city ever would in a lifetime. They can be real neighbours from hell. \\n\\nSpeaking of hell the weather is literally worse the further you get from the coastal suburbs. Few years back it got to 49 Celsius in some parts of western Sydney. For American readers like yourself that\'s around 120F! Odds are it never got that hot in this part of this country before when it was still forested, but urban sprawl like in the picture above and your typical \\"westie\'s\\" *remarkable* hatred of trees on their property means the heat island effect really doubles down on the summer temperatures.

You are turning your brain off to too much here.\\n\\nOne of the other posters has it mostly right. Assuming you do not have a deficient roof install, which I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out categorically because of how shoddy the ceiling install is, root cause is interior humidity.\\n\\nThere are two probable sources:\\n1) the ground below the concrete slab\\n2) water that comes in frozen to a vehicle as ice and then thaws and soaks into the floor slab\\n\\nThe first thing to know is that if you bought this house, it should have a warranty, and this issue should be warrantable until you start doing the work yourself. This is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal thing with every house\xe2\x80\x9d, this is grossly deficient design and construction. In other words, we knew how to avoid this kind of stuff reliably by the tail end of the 1970s if not earlier.\\n\\nIf you replace the assembly with the same assembly, the same thing will happen. Heat, fans, and/or lack thereof are not your problem. This is a garage. The mould is not going to kill you any more quickly than residual exhaust fumes. If you are going to replace the drywall, the reason to do so would be to get rid of the food source for the mould (wood fibres that make up the paper face) FOR GOOD.\\n\\nAnother poster mentioned the solution was OSB. OSB is made of\xe2\x80\xa6. wood fibre. OSB is not a permissible wall treatment for an attached garage unless applied IN CONJUNCTION WITH a continuous layer of drywall. So don\xe2\x80\x99t use OSB. If you wanted to use glass mat sheathing like you can see on commercial exteriors (e.g. SecuRock, GlasRoc, DensGlass Gold, etc.) \xe2\x80\xa6. it exists\xe2\x80\xa6. it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper than Mold Tough\xe2\x80\xa6 you could do it and finish it like regular drywall and paint over it. I have used it for painted ceilings where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the roofing install a whole lot. But until you figure out how to stop getting new mold growth with the existing assembly, just hold your horses and figure out the root cause.\\n\\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the facts:\\n\\n1. Mold needs food, water, heat to grow\\n2. Parking a wet car inside is sometimes desirable\\n3. The best thing for any building is always to just keep the wet stuff out of it\\n4. We assume it\xe2\x80\x99s of critical importance to \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to use the garage we paid for\xe2\x80\x9d and that means water is going to come in as snow / rain / puddle water\\n5. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want water to adsorb into the floor because it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the floor and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to warm the floor enough to get it back out via evaporation (at least on our schedule)\\n6. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have floor drains because nobody puts those in residential garages even though they are critically important in cold climates where cars get snow on them\\n7. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a good vapour barrier under our slab, but we assume there is something preventing the wicking of bulk ground moisture from wicking up into the floor from below\\n8. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend more money than we have to - if the ceiling weren\xe2\x80\x99t showing mould spots, we would be worried about other things than starting a construction project in the garage\\n\\nIf that checks out:\\n\\n1. You want a siloxane coating for the garage floor to inhibit the adsorption of liquid water into the floor slab where it is harder to control\\n2. You want a lot of heat at/near the floor blowing across the floor at floor height\\n3. You want exhaust from at ceiling height\\n4. You want a MORE airtight ceiling, not a less airtight ceiling - and you want airtight walls - and you need to get the bottom-of-wall airtight somehow too - see discussion below.\\n5. The exhausted air needs to come from somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6. you do not want it coming from the house proper - just believe me on that one lest I launch into a huge sub-discussion.\\n6. Replacing finishes without addressing root causes in proportion to the massive amount of moisture a car can bring into a garage each day is going to be a frustrating exercise because youm\xe2\x80\x99ll do it more than once and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the damage just moves to another location that\xe2\x80\x99s more expensive to fix, like rot in the roof sheathing itself or mould on hidden framing members instead of on visible surfaces.\\n\\nAll of this is a lot more expensive than getting a lawyer to get your builder to get a design professional in to design an appropriate fix for the root causes and make the builder pay for sorting everything out. Whether or not you pursue that route is a matter of how financially successful the builder is and your taste in life\xe2\x80\xa6. I am not an expert on new home warranty / title insurance stuff.\\n\\nRe: airtight ceilings, walls, etc.:\\n\\n1. You have a moisture problem\\n2. The moisture is coming from the interior of the garage and/or from the soil below the slab\\n3. The moisture is getting to the ceiling in sufficient quantity to get the paper facer wet enough for long enough that mold is growing\\n4. The AIR is the only vector by which moisture could be moving to the ceiling - point being: air can move a lot of moisture.\\n\\nWhat is probably happening in the specific areas that have the worst mold growth is that there is insufficient airtightness at the ceiling plane (because the drywall is not finished) to STOP the interior humid air from bypassing the relatively warm ceiling (it must be warm at least seasonally - I would guess more often than seasonally - after all it\xe2\x80\x99s growing mold) and reaching the much, much colder underside of the roof sheathing (i.e. OSB or plywood decking roof decking) where it\xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it\xe2\x80\xa6. turns into water droplets and falls onto the top surface of the drywall board right above the mold growth.\\n\\nSo in other words you have a rainforest microclimate in your garage ceiling and part of the answer is that you need to keep the moisture that evaporates off the car and off the floor after falling off the car in the room as water-vapour-laden-air and exhaust it mechanically (with a fan) to the exterior of the building\xe2\x80\xa6.. or if you have money and want the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d option just aggressively dehumidify the room 24/7.\\n\\nIf you have any non-high efficiency appliances (water heater, furnace) or a gas range\xe2\x80\xa6. or if you have a forced air outlet connecting the garage to the main furnace for the house\xe2\x80\xa6. you have to be extremely careful about putting new fans anywhere\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x9csucking smoke down the chimney\xe2\x80\x9d type stuff can and does happen.\\n\\nA lot of construction guys have an anti-intellectual complex where the answer is that \xe2\x80\x9ccode is stupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuildings need to breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. This is not code (it\xe2\x80\x99s also perhaps not far from being code with some adjustments) and buildings don\xe2\x80\x99t need to breathe, they need to be ventilated appropriately for occupant health (which means not too little, otherwise the occupants run out of oxygen, and not too much, otherwise the occupants turn into raisins) and to control moisture loads and other loads (like water dripping off a car that was just outside or someone taking a shower).\\n\\nMore than you asked for in a more assured tone than you asked for\xe2\x80\xa6. good luck. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get screwed by people who think they know everything there is to know about buildings because they know one or two trades pretty well. I know zero trades really well and every trade well enough to know when someone else is overconfident or is not speaking impartially. Your particular problem is something that has always and will always be a builder-level issue because no subtrade can guarantee it won\xe2\x80\x99t materialize based only on the quality of their specific part of the build.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_12z0u3n","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Winnipeg/comments/12z0u3n/mold_in_new_garage_help/ji0lo0s/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656923,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Winnipeg","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656937,"updated_utc":1682656938,"body_sha1":"dc1b78c02814ab13008cbbe578f14bfc564d20d3","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:42:03"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhkh","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"gardening","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lm0a","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"NootHawg","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9ul8oh6m","all_awardings":[],"body":"When you think about it this could be everywhere in the US in no time with very minimal modifications or reinforcements to the structure.

I will explain my logic here as well. \\n\\n***1) What do you need to keep running. How much power do you actually need to exist comfortably in the home. ***\\n\\nMy logic here is that a oversized generator will burn through fuel at a faster rate than one that is smaller. Since you do not have natural gas, you are limited in run time to what you can store.\\n\\nI have an electric dryer, Propane stove, propane hot water, and a heat pump (with propane backup) in my home.\\n\\nMy energy usage varies significantly. The numbers here do not include my heat pump at all, since that is metered separately but do include my furnace fan. \\n\\nFor an example on 4/23/2023 I used 49.35 KW of power,  the bulk of which was my dryer (I washed my feather pillows that take hours to dry in there) My hourly range was .62 kWh - 3.55 kWh. This would not include my heating needs on this day.\\nFor the most part, my home I draw less than 1,000 watts, with some fairly large peaks (like my well pump which pulls 16 amps @ 120v.)\\n\\nWhat i found is that I can run my home just fine off my little 2500 Peak, 2200 running generator. However, if I want to run the AC, or the well pump, or run the microwave, with anything else running but lighting it can\xe2\x80\x99t power that load. However the vast majority of the time that runs just fine and consumes very little fuel. I should say, I can run my well, with no load anywhere else on this little guy if I plug the well into the generator directly (Keep in mind I have a 120v well pump) and the guy that owned the house before made his own disconnect by taking a extension plug ends and using those to make it work like a normal outlet, super janky but I guess it could come in handy. I will fix this when I rebuild the pump house this summer. \\n\\n***2) How long do you need to run for without going out to refuel, how long are you willing to store the fuel, and general situations around the use.\\n\\nSo here, when I get a storm that takes the power out, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty reasonable to have a better idea when power will be restored, gas stations that are open, etc in a few hours but for sure less than a day. Because of this, I keep enough gas for the generator on the property for 24 hours to run the large one, or about 48 hours of the smaller one. Realistically I can run the small one all but for a few hours a day to shower and do laundry.\\n\\nWhen you are expecting a hurricane I imagine it could take longer than that to resupply so I suspect you would want a longer term storage to provide you time to find out a way to reply your fuel. I suspect this is a few days for you?\\n\\nNow let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about actually starting the generator. When I have a storm during the summer usually it\xe2\x80\x99s short lived where I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go outside. For this I have a UPS that powers my internet, a flashlight, and a cord that I can plug the iPad into watch local over the air tv or steam the local news to find out when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to exit the home to turn it on. We\xe2\x80\x99re usually talking about 30 min to an hour max. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a snow storm this is not a concern.\\n\\nDuring the peak of the hurricane are you going to want to go outside to start one or is a standby solution better? Are you going to be able to go outside to refill it?\\n\\nMy guess is no, and a propane generator that\xe2\x80\x99s connected to a large propane tank may be the way to go. However running off that for a month sounds very expensive. A whole house generator could burn through a 500 gallon tank (so 400 gallons usable) in 4 days pretty easily. I paid 2.15 a gallon and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay 800+ for a few days of power. At $4 a gallon 4 days would cost me less than 300 without being mindful about how I used it.\\n\\nThen you got to think about how long can you run it without servicing? I can run my big one for 100 hours on synthetic oil before needing to change it. So a little over 4 days. Splitting that into half of each I can go 8 days. My older little generator though I just do it once in the spring and once in the winter. It\xe2\x80\x99s old.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13055o8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/preppers/comments/13055o8/looking_to_get_a_whole_house_generator/ji0lgui/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656797,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/preppers","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656813,"updated_utc":1682656814,"body_sha1":"fb69b213450b33ccdb9aec3c7ab808d6e01c73de","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:39:57"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u82k","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"askportland","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lgnx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"birdVVoman","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1uxevea4","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\xe2\x80\x99m from Oklahoma and have lived in the PNW 20 years.

I know, I live in it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst you\'re about an hour\'s commute away from the \\"Sydney\\" that foreigners know of. The harbour, beaches, shops, restaurants, parks and just overall culture, excitement and visual appeal that the eastern and northern parts of the city have to offer. Of course you can live in these areas too - if you\'re a millionaire. But what about those who are doing most of the real work in this otherwise fine city?\\n\\nThey/we are shoved into the outer western and south-western parts of the city. Hour to the CBD (and the better job opportunities that only exist there). Hour (or more) to any decent beaches and you\'re gonna be sitting in fucking traffic either trip. There\'s trains too but often you\'ll still have to drive to the stations and there seems to be track work or something going on every month so relying on public transport can really fuck up your day sometimes. There\'s less in terms of nice shops or restaurants around, I\'ve seen some come and go - they\'re usually ended because of lack of business catering to the markets out here who many of which actually do make plenty of money but would rather spend it on gambling or alcohol instead. Or having a fourth child they can\'t afford. Lots of drugs out here. I\'ve lived next to drug users and dealers more times than anyone in a not-shit part of the city ever would in a lifetime. They can be real neighbours from hell. \\n\\nSpeaking of hell the weather is literally worse the further you get from the coastal suburbs. Few years back it got to 49 Celsius in some parts of western Sydney. For American readers like yourself that\'s around 120F! Odds are it never got that hot in this part of this country before when it was still forested, but urban sprawl like in the picture above and your typical \\"westie\'s\\" *remarkable* hatred of trees on their property means the heat island effect really doubles down on the summer temperatures.

You are turning your brain off to too much here.\\n\\nOne of the other posters has it mostly right. Assuming you do not have a deficient roof install, which I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out categorically because of how shoddy the ceiling install is, root cause is interior humidity.\\n\\nThere are two probable sources:\\n1) the ground below the concrete slab\\n2) water that comes in frozen to a vehicle as ice and then thaws and soaks into the floor slab\\n\\nThe first thing to know is that if you bought this house, it should have a warranty, and this issue should be warrantable until you start doing the work yourself. This is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal thing with every house\xe2\x80\x9d, this is grossly deficient design and construction. In other words, we knew how to avoid this kind of stuff reliably by the tail end of the 1970s if not earlier.\\n\\nIf you replace the assembly with the same assembly, the same thing will happen. Heat, fans, and/or lack thereof are not your problem. This is a garage. The mould is not going to kill you any more quickly than residual exhaust fumes. If you are going to replace the drywall, the reason to do so would be to get rid of the food source for the mould (wood fibres that make up the paper face) FOR GOOD.\\n\\nAnother poster mentioned the solution was OSB. OSB is made of\xe2\x80\xa6. wood fibre. OSB is not a permissible wall treatment for an attached garage unless applied IN CONJUNCTION WITH a continuous layer of drywall. So don\xe2\x80\x99t use OSB. If you wanted to use glass mat sheathing like you can see on commercial exteriors (e.g. SecuRock, GlasRoc, DensGlass Gold, etc.) \xe2\x80\xa6. it exists\xe2\x80\xa6. it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper than Mold Tough\xe2\x80\xa6 you could do it and finish it like regular drywall and paint over it. I have used it for painted ceilings where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the roofing install a whole lot. But until you figure out how to stop getting new mold growth with the existing assembly, just hold your horses and figure out the root cause.\\n\\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the facts:\\n\\n1. Mold needs food, water, heat to grow\\n2. Parking a wet car inside is sometimes desirable\\n3. The best thing for any building is always to just keep the wet stuff out of it\\n4. We assume it\xe2\x80\x99s of critical importance to \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to use the garage we paid for\xe2\x80\x9d and that means water is going to come in as snow / rain / puddle water\\n5. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want water to adsorb into the floor because it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the floor and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to warm the floor enough to get it back out via evaporation (at least on our schedule)\\n6. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have floor drains because nobody puts those in residential garages even though they are critically important in cold climates where cars get snow on them\\n7. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a good vapour barrier under our slab, but we assume there is something preventing the wicking of bulk ground moisture from wicking up into the floor from below\\n8. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend more money than we have to - if the ceiling weren\xe2\x80\x99t showing mould spots, we would be worried about other things than starting a construction project in the garage\\n\\nIf that checks out:\\n\\n1. You want a siloxane coating for the garage floor to inhibit the adsorption of liquid water into the floor slab where it is harder to control\\n2. You want a lot of heat at/near the floor blowing across the floor at floor height\\n3. You want exhaust from at ceiling height\\n4. You want a MORE airtight ceiling, not a less airtight ceiling - and you want airtight walls - and you need to get the bottom-of-wall airtight somehow too - see discussion below.\\n5. The exhausted air needs to come from somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6. you do not want it coming from the house proper - just believe me on that one lest I launch into a huge sub-discussion.\\n6. Replacing finishes without addressing root causes in proportion to the massive amount of moisture a car can bring into a garage each day is going to be a frustrating exercise because youm\xe2\x80\x99ll do it more than once and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the damage just moves to another location that\xe2\x80\x99s more expensive to fix, like rot in the roof sheathing itself or mould on hidden framing members instead of on visible surfaces.\\n\\nAll of this is a lot more expensive than getting a lawyer to get your builder to get a design professional in to design an appropriate fix for the root causes and make the builder pay for sorting everything out. Whether or not you pursue that route is a matter of how financially successful the builder is and your taste in life\xe2\x80\xa6. I am not an expert on new home warranty / title insurance stuff.\\n\\nRe: airtight ceilings, walls, etc.:\\n\\n1. You have a moisture problem\\n2. The moisture is coming from the interior of the garage and/or from the soil below the slab\\n3. The moisture is getting to the ceiling in sufficient quantity to get the paper facer wet enough for long enough that mold is growing\\n4. The AIR is the only vector by which moisture could be moving to the ceiling - point being: air can move a lot of moisture.\\n\\nWhat is probably happening in the specific areas that have the worst mold growth is that there is insufficient airtightness at the ceiling plane (because the drywall is not finished) to STOP the interior humid air from bypassing the relatively warm ceiling (it must be warm at least seasonally - I would guess more often than seasonally - after all it\xe2\x80\x99s growing mold) and reaching the much, much colder underside of the roof sheathing (i.e. OSB or plywood decking roof decking) where it\xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it\xe2\x80\xa6. turns into water droplets and falls onto the top surface of the drywall board right above the mold growth.\\n\\nSo in other words you have a rainforest microclimate in your garage ceiling and part of the answer is that you need to keep the moisture that evaporates off the car and off the floor after falling off the car in the room as water-vapour-laden-air and exhaust it mechanically (with a fan) to the exterior of the building\xe2\x80\xa6.. or if you have money and want the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d option just aggressively dehumidify the room 24/7.\\n\\nIf you have any non-high efficiency appliances (water heater, furnace) or a gas range\xe2\x80\xa6. or if you have a forced air outlet connecting the garage to the main furnace for the house\xe2\x80\xa6. you have to be extremely careful about putting new fans anywhere\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x9csucking smoke down the chimney\xe2\x80\x9d type stuff can and does happen.\\n\\nA lot of construction guys have an anti-intellectual complex where the answer is that \xe2\x80\x9ccode is stupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuildings need to breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. This is not code (it\xe2\x80\x99s also perhaps not far from being code with some adjustments) and buildings don\xe2\x80\x99t need to breathe, they need to be ventilated appropriately for occupant health (which means not too little, otherwise the occupants run out of oxygen, and not too much, otherwise the occupants turn into raisins) and to control moisture loads and other loads (like water dripping off a car that was just outside or someone taking a shower).\\n\\nMore than you asked for in a more assured tone than you asked for\xe2\x80\xa6. good luck. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get screwed by people who think they know everything there is to know about buildings because they know one or two trades pretty well. I know zero trades really well and every trade well enough to know when someone else is overconfident or is not speaking impartially. Your particular problem is something that has always and will always be a builder-level issue because no subtrade can guarantee it won\xe2\x80\x99t materialize based only on the quality of their specific part of the build.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_12z0u3n","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Winnipeg/comments/12z0u3n/mold_in_new_garage_help/ji0lo0s/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656923,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Winnipeg","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656937,"updated_utc":1682656938,"body_sha1":"dc1b78c02814ab13008cbbe578f14bfc564d20d3","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:42:03"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhkh","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"gardening","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lm0a","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"NootHawg","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9ul8oh6m","all_awardings":[],"body":"When you think about it this could be everywhere in the US in no time with very minimal modifications or reinforcements to the structure.

I will explain my logic here as well. \\n\\n***1) What do you need to keep running. How much power do you actually need to exist comfortably in the home. ***\\n\\nMy logic here is that a oversized generator will burn through fuel at a faster rate than one that is smaller. Since you do not have natural gas, you are limited in run time to what you can store.\\n\\nI have an electric dryer, Propane stove, propane hot water, and a heat pump (with propane backup) in my home.\\n\\nMy energy usage varies significantly. The numbers here do not include my heat pump at all, since that is metered separately but do include my furnace fan. \\n\\nFor an example on 4/23/2023 I used 49.35 KW of power,  the bulk of which was my dryer (I washed my feather pillows that take hours to dry in there) My hourly range was .62 kWh - 3.55 kWh. This would not include my heating needs on this day.\\nFor the most part, my home I draw less than 1,000 watts, with some fairly large peaks (like my well pump which pulls 16 amps @ 120v.)\\n\\nWhat i found is that I can run my home just fine off my little 2500 Peak, 2200 running generator. However, if I want to run the AC, or the well pump, or run the microwave, with anything else running but lighting it can\xe2\x80\x99t power that load. However the vast majority of the time that runs just fine and consumes very little fuel. I should say, I can run my well, with no load anywhere else on this little guy if I plug the well into the generator directly (Keep in mind I have a 120v well pump) and the guy that owned the house before made his own disconnect by taking a extension plug ends and using those to make it work like a normal outlet, super janky but I guess it could come in handy. I will fix this when I rebuild the pump house this summer. \\n\\n***2) How long do you need to run for without going out to refuel, how long are you willing to store the fuel, and general situations around the use.\\n\\nSo here, when I get a storm that takes the power out, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty reasonable to have a better idea when power will be restored, gas stations that are open, etc in a few hours but for sure less than a day. Because of this, I keep enough gas for the generator on the property for 24 hours to run the large one, or about 48 hours of the smaller one. Realistically I can run the small one all but for a few hours a day to shower and do laundry.\\n\\nWhen you are expecting a hurricane I imagine it could take longer than that to resupply so I suspect you would want a longer term storage to provide you time to find out a way to reply your fuel. I suspect this is a few days for you?\\n\\nNow let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about actually starting the generator. When I have a storm during the summer usually it\xe2\x80\x99s short lived where I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go outside. For this I have a UPS that powers my internet, a flashlight, and a cord that I can plug the iPad into watch local over the air tv or steam the local news to find out when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to exit the home to turn it on. We\xe2\x80\x99re usually talking about 30 min to an hour max. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a snow storm this is not a concern.\\n\\nDuring the peak of the hurricane are you going to want to go outside to start one or is a standby solution better? Are you going to be able to go outside to refill it?\\n\\nMy guess is no, and a propane generator that\xe2\x80\x99s connected to a large propane tank may be the way to go. However running off that for a month sounds very expensive. A whole house generator could burn through a 500 gallon tank (so 400 gallons usable) in 4 days pretty easily. I paid 2.15 a gallon and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay 800+ for a few days of power. At $4 a gallon 4 days would cost me less than 300 without being mindful about how I used it.\\n\\nThen you got to think about how long can you run it without servicing? I can run my big one for 100 hours on synthetic oil before needing to change it. So a little over 4 days. Splitting that into half of each I can go 8 days. My older little generator though I just do it once in the spring and once in the winter. It\xe2\x80\x99s old.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13055o8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/preppers/comments/13055o8/looking_to_get_a_whole_house_generator/ji0lgui/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656797,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/preppers","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656813,"updated_utc":1682656814,"body_sha1":"fb69b213450b33ccdb9aec3c7ab808d6e01c73de","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:39:57"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u82k","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"askportland","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lgnx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"birdVVoman","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1uxevea4","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\xe2\x80\x99m from Oklahoma and have lived in the PNW 20 years.

I know, I live in it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst you\'re about an hour\'s commute away from the \\"Sydney\\" that foreigners know of. The harbour, beaches, shops, restaurants, parks and just overall culture, excitement and visual appeal that the eastern and northern parts of the city have to offer. Of course you can live in these areas too - if you\'re a millionaire. But what about those who are doing most of the real work in this otherwise fine city?\\n\\nThey/we are shoved into the outer western and south-western parts of the city. Hour to the CBD (and the better job opportunities that only exist there). Hour (or more) to any decent beaches and you\'re gonna be sitting in fucking traffic either trip. There\'s trains too but often you\'ll still have to drive to the stations and there seems to be track work or something going on every month so relying on public transport can really fuck up your day sometimes. There\'s less in terms of nice shops or restaurants around, I\'ve seen some come and go - they\'re usually ended because of lack of business catering to the markets out here who many of which actually do make plenty of money but would rather spend it on gambling or alcohol instead. Or having a fourth child they can\'t afford. Lots of drugs out here. I\'ve lived next to drug users and dealers more times than anyone in a not-shit part of the city ever would in a lifetime. They can be real neighbours from hell. \\n\\nSpeaking of hell the weather is literally worse the further you get from the coastal suburbs. Few years back it got to 49 Celsius in some parts of western Sydney. For American readers like yourself that\'s around 120F! Odds are it never got that hot in this part of this country before when it was still forested, but urban sprawl like in the picture above and your typical \\"westie\'s\\" *remarkable* hatred of trees on their property means the heat island effect really doubles down on the summer temperatures.

You are turning your brain off to too much here.\\n\\nOne of the other posters has it mostly right. Assuming you do not have a deficient roof install, which I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out categorically because of how shoddy the ceiling install is, root cause is interior humidity.\\n\\nThere are two probable sources:\\n1) the ground below the concrete slab\\n2) water that comes in frozen to a vehicle as ice and then thaws and soaks into the floor slab\\n\\nThe first thing to know is that if you bought this house, it should have a warranty, and this issue should be warrantable until you start doing the work yourself. This is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal thing with every house\xe2\x80\x9d, this is grossly deficient design and construction. In other words, we knew how to avoid this kind of stuff reliably by the tail end of the 1970s if not earlier.\\n\\nIf you replace the assembly with the same assembly, the same thing will happen. Heat, fans, and/or lack thereof are not your problem. This is a garage. The mould is not going to kill you any more quickly than residual exhaust fumes. If you are going to replace the drywall, the reason to do so would be to get rid of the food source for the mould (wood fibres that make up the paper face) FOR GOOD.\\n\\nAnother poster mentioned the solution was OSB. OSB is made of\xe2\x80\xa6. wood fibre. OSB is not a permissible wall treatment for an attached garage unless applied IN CONJUNCTION WITH a continuous layer of drywall. So don\xe2\x80\x99t use OSB. If you wanted to use glass mat sheathing like you can see on commercial exteriors (e.g. SecuRock, GlasRoc, DensGlass Gold, etc.) \xe2\x80\xa6. it exists\xe2\x80\xa6. it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper than Mold Tough\xe2\x80\xa6 you could do it and finish it like regular drywall and paint over it. I have used it for painted ceilings where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the roofing install a whole lot. But until you figure out how to stop getting new mold growth with the existing assembly, just hold your horses and figure out the root cause.\\n\\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the facts:\\n\\n1. Mold needs food, water, heat to grow\\n2. Parking a wet car inside is sometimes desirable\\n3. The best thing for any building is always to just keep the wet stuff out of it\\n4. We assume it\xe2\x80\x99s of critical importance to \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to use the garage we paid for\xe2\x80\x9d and that means water is going to come in as snow / rain / puddle water\\n5. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want water to adsorb into the floor because it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the floor and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to warm the floor enough to get it back out via evaporation (at least on our schedule)\\n6. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have floor drains because nobody puts those in residential garages even though they are critically important in cold climates where cars get snow on them\\n7. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a good vapour barrier under our slab, but we assume there is something preventing the wicking of bulk ground moisture from wicking up into the floor from below\\n8. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend more money than we have to - if the ceiling weren\xe2\x80\x99t showing mould spots, we would be worried about other things than starting a construction project in the garage\\n\\nIf that checks out:\\n\\n1. You want a siloxane coating for the garage floor to inhibit the adsorption of liquid water into the floor slab where it is harder to control\\n2. You want a lot of heat at/near the floor blowing across the floor at floor height\\n3. You want exhaust from at ceiling height\\n4. You want a MORE airtight ceiling, not a less airtight ceiling - and you want airtight walls - and you need to get the bottom-of-wall airtight somehow too - see discussion below.\\n5. The exhausted air needs to come from somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6. you do not want it coming from the house proper - just believe me on that one lest I launch into a huge sub-discussion.\\n6. Replacing finishes without addressing root causes in proportion to the massive amount of moisture a car can bring into a garage each day is going to be a frustrating exercise because youm\xe2\x80\x99ll do it more than once and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the damage just moves to another location that\xe2\x80\x99s more expensive to fix, like rot in the roof sheathing itself or mould on hidden framing members instead of on visible surfaces.\\n\\nAll of this is a lot more expensive than getting a lawyer to get your builder to get a design professional in to design an appropriate fix for the root causes and make the builder pay for sorting everything out. Whether or not you pursue that route is a matter of how financially successful the builder is and your taste in life\xe2\x80\xa6. I am not an expert on new home warranty / title insurance stuff.\\n\\nRe: airtight ceilings, walls, etc.:\\n\\n1. You have a moisture problem\\n2. The moisture is coming from the interior of the garage and/or from the soil below the slab\\n3. The moisture is getting to the ceiling in sufficient quantity to get the paper facer wet enough for long enough that mold is growing\\n4. The AIR is the only vector by which moisture could be moving to the ceiling - point being: air can move a lot of moisture.\\n\\nWhat is probably happening in the specific areas that have the worst mold growth is that there is insufficient airtightness at the ceiling plane (because the drywall is not finished) to STOP the interior humid air from bypassing the relatively warm ceiling (it must be warm at least seasonally - I would guess more often than seasonally - after all it\xe2\x80\x99s growing mold) and reaching the much, much colder underside of the roof sheathing (i.e. OSB or plywood decking roof decking) where it\xe2\x80\xa6 wait for it\xe2\x80\xa6. turns into water droplets and falls onto the top surface of the drywall board right above the mold growth.\\n\\nSo in other words you have a rainforest microclimate in your garage ceiling and part of the answer is that you need to keep the moisture that evaporates off the car and off the floor after falling off the car in the room as water-vapour-laden-air and exhaust it mechanically (with a fan) to the exterior of the building\xe2\x80\xa6.. or if you have money and want the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d option just aggressively dehumidify the room 24/7.\\n\\nIf you have any non-high efficiency appliances (water heater, furnace) or a gas range\xe2\x80\xa6. or if you have a forced air outlet connecting the garage to the main furnace for the house\xe2\x80\xa6. you have to be extremely careful about putting new fans anywhere\xe2\x80\xa6. \xe2\x80\x9csucking smoke down the chimney\xe2\x80\x9d type stuff can and does happen.\\n\\nA lot of construction guys have an anti-intellectual complex where the answer is that \xe2\x80\x9ccode is stupid\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuildings need to breathe\xe2\x80\x9d. This is not code (it\xe2\x80\x99s also perhaps not far from being code with some adjustments) and buildings don\xe2\x80\x99t need to breathe, they need to be ventilated appropriately for occupant health (which means not too little, otherwise the occupants run out of oxygen, and not too much, otherwise the occupants turn into raisins) and to control moisture loads and other loads (like water dripping off a car that was just outside or someone taking a shower).\\n\\nMore than you asked for in a more assured tone than you asked for\xe2\x80\xa6. good luck. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get screwed by people who think they know everything there is to know about buildings because they know one or two trades pretty well. I know zero trades really well and every trade well enough to know when someone else is overconfident or is not speaking impartially. Your particular problem is something that has always and will always be a builder-level issue because no subtrade can guarantee it won\xe2\x80\x99t materialize based only on the quality of their specific part of the build.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_12z0u3n","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Winnipeg/comments/12z0u3n/mold_in_new_garage_help/ji0lo0s/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656923,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Winnipeg","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656937,"updated_utc":1682656938,"body_sha1":"dc1b78c02814ab13008cbbe578f14bfc564d20d3","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:42:03"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhkh","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"gardening","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lm0a","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"NootHawg","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9ul8oh6m","all_awardings":[],"body":"When you think about it this could be everywhere in the US in no time with very minimal modifications or reinforcements to the structure.

I will explain my logic here as well. \\n\\n***1) What do you need to keep running. How much power do you actually need to exist comfortably in the home. ***\\n\\nMy logic here is that a oversized generator will burn through fuel at a faster rate than one that is smaller. Since you do not have natural gas, you are limited in run time to what you can store.\\n\\nI have an electric dryer, Propane stove, propane hot water, and a heat pump (with propane backup) in my home.\\n\\nMy energy usage varies significantly. The numbers here do not include my heat pump at all, since that is metered separately but do include my furnace fan. \\n\\nFor an example on 4/23/2023 I used 49.35 KW of power,  the bulk of which was my dryer (I washed my feather pillows that take hours to dry in there) My hourly range was .62 kWh - 3.55 kWh. This would not include my heating needs on this day.\\nFor the most part, my home I draw less than 1,000 watts, with some fairly large peaks (like my well pump which pulls 16 amps @ 120v.)\\n\\nWhat i found is that I can run my home just fine off my little 2500 Peak, 2200 running generator. However, if I want to run the AC, or the well pump, or run the microwave, with anything else running but lighting it can\xe2\x80\x99t power that load. However the vast majority of the time that runs just fine and consumes very little fuel. I should say, I can run my well, with no load anywhere else on this little guy if I plug the well into the generator directly (Keep in mind I have a 120v well pump) and the guy that owned the house before made his own disconnect by taking a extension plug ends and using those to make it work like a normal outlet, super janky but I guess it could come in handy. I will fix this when I rebuild the pump house this summer. \\n\\n***2) How long do you need to run for without going out to refuel, how long are you willing to store the fuel, and general situations around the use.\\n\\nSo here, when I get a storm that takes the power out, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty reasonable to have a better idea when power will be restored, gas stations that are open, etc in a few hours but for sure less than a day. Because of this, I keep enough gas for the generator on the property for 24 hours to run the large one, or about 48 hours of the smaller one. Realistically I can run the small one all but for a few hours a day to shower and do laundry.\\n\\nWhen you are expecting a hurricane I imagine it could take longer than that to resupply so I suspect you would want a longer term storage to provide you time to find out a way to reply your fuel. I suspect this is a few days for you?\\n\\nNow let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about actually starting the generator. When I have a storm during the summer usually it\xe2\x80\x99s short lived where I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go outside. For this I have a UPS that powers my internet, a flashlight, and a cord that I can plug the iPad into watch local over the air tv or steam the local news to find out when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to exit the home to turn it on. We\xe2\x80\x99re usually talking about 30 min to an hour max. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a snow storm this is not a concern.\\n\\nDuring the peak of the hurricane are you going to want to go outside to start one or is a standby solution better? Are you going to be able to go outside to refill it?\\n\\nMy guess is no, and a propane generator that\xe2\x80\x99s connected to a large propane tank may be the way to go. However running off that for a month sounds very expensive. A whole house generator could burn through a 500 gallon tank (so 400 gallons usable) in 4 days pretty easily. I paid 2.15 a gallon and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay 800+ for a few days of power. At $4 a gallon 4 days would cost me less than 300 without being mindful about how I used it.\\n\\nThen you got to think about how long can you run it without servicing? I can run my big one for 100 hours on synthetic oil before needing to change it. So a little over 4 days. Splitting that into half of each I can go 8 days. My older little generator though I just do it once in the spring and once in the winter. It\xe2\x80\x99s old.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13055o8","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/preppers/comments/13055o8/looking_to_get_a_whole_house_generator/ji0lgui/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682656797,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/preppers","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682656813,"updated_utc":1682656814,"body_sha1":"fb69b213450b33ccdb9aec3c7ab808d6e01c73de","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:39:57"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u82k","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"askportland","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0lgnx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"birdVVoman","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_1uxevea4","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\xe2\x80\x99m from Oklahoma and have lived in the PNW 20 years.
