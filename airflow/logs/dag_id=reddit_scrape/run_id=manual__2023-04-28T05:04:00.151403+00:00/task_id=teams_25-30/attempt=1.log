chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

chapters soo good for a variety of reasons but I think the current highlight is how it blends into the larger end game story Oda has been weaving since Wano ended. While the 3 Supernovas have an impact wherever they go, it\'s only the 4 emperors who are truly capable of shifting the way the world turns and upsetting the current status quo. \\n\\nWith that said, we are finally getting a peek into how each of them live their lives as a pirate and from that what they think being the pirate king would help them achieve. Big Mom, Kaido, and Whitebeard were absolute monsters, each possessing a resolute goal and dream of the future they sought with their power, absolutely, but they grew up in the last generation under Rocks. The current 4 all grew up in Roger\'s great pirate age and all experienced that romance dawn of wealth, fame, and power of the Pirate King! \\nThe past few chapters build a narrative around how different each of them are when it comes to why they grow powerful and what about the current regime needs to change for them to achieve their dreams. We could write essays about it with how much source material One Piece has, but I am so excited to finally see a glimpse into Shanks, Blackbeard, and Buggy\'s points of view after all these chapters! \\n\\nBuggy will always be arguably the best non Straw Hat character because of how hilarious he is! He\'s fully aware how precarious his position is yet also has spun a miraculous web of charisma to actually land himself with so much wealth and fame. He\'s basically the Spandam of the Emperors but still grew up on Roger\'s ship and has his own pirate ambitions. He is a clown and used his theater prowess to put on a show and is now an Emperor! He just inspired \'his\' crew to be the kind of pirate he saw in Roger and he\'s not gonna let the opportunity go to waste when Mihawk and Crocodile are gonna flay him alive anyways!!\\nBlackbeard waited for certain devil fruits to appear to leverage his position towards his ambitions. We have a lot to learn about his past as he likes history and could\'ve been alive during Rocks\' reign for sure but he set the current age off by capturing Ace and getting WB to die. He\'s incredibly knowledgeable on what his limits are but has grown his forces considerably toeing that line.\\n\\nShanks is Roger\'s protege but likely saw Big Mom and Kaido as too unpredictable to move around. He basically waited for them to die while protecting people he met on his journies from the crazy powerful people that exist in the world. Excited to see what drives him since he probably knew from Roger and Rayleigh they were early and needed to wait.\\n\\nAnd finally we have Dragon and Sabo showing up too! While the pirates seek the freedom that comes with being a pirate king, the revolutionaries directly oppose the current kings in the celestial dragons. The current WG uses Justice to justify their elites freedoms and don\'t hesitate to commit atrocities in their name so they feel like the final big actors in this magnificent end game Odas giving us :)\\n\\nSry for wall of text, tldr past few chapters   emphasize how each emperor represents a different kind of piracy. They all want to be king for different reasons but Buggy is the goat for sacrificing himself to still compete :,)\\nWG is basically a big established pirate crew with a king and the Monkey family sees right through the facade!","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130htqk","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/130htqk/one_piece_chapter_1082/ji0mkey/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657498,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OnePiece","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657513,"updated_utc":1682657514,"body_sha1":"e0918d8c51ada67d5c9cc4c122b735d7ee139256","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"c752a526-3feb-11e8-84bb-0ea4bf1137fc","id":"ji0mj78","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Fethah","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42448298155,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_iflwq","all_awardings":[],"body":"Not a kings fan in here trying to claim the refs are rigged AGAINST them \xf0\x9f\x92\x80","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Warriors5","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":true,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":gsw-5:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gou1gyxj4f691_t5_2qo4s/gsw-5"},{"e":"text","t":" Warriors"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fr73","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fr73/highlight_malik_monk_shows_why_officiating_nba/ji0mj78/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":gsw-5: Warriors","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682657478,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682657491,"updated_utc":1682657491,"body_sha1":"cf399ad26069d27167b437a0edbbdd2f26f9500c","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:51:18"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qiap","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"springfieldMO","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0mix3","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PassingWithJennifer","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_6a92d4z81","all_awardings":[],"body":"This sounds made up. \\n\\nDrag queen Story hour is not something that happens at school typically.

Like another user said the debunked kitty litter thing comes to mind. \\n\\nThere is a lot of misguided hate for drag queens and even though drag queens are cis men presenting female, somehow it gets used as the scape goat to attack trans people. I think that\'s because drag queens tend to look...uncanny and therefore easier to attack trans people. Because passing trans people just look like ordinary men or women without the performative flamboyant energy, typically. But like I said the hate is usually misguided. The problem is that the right thinks transvesticism is a strictly sexual thing or a fetish, and that might be true in some cases in adult settings, drag by itself is just a man wearing women\'s clothes and makeup. Unless you think women\'s clothes and makeup are inherently sexual then that should seem silly. It\'s just dressing different. \\n\\nThere are drag kings too. Women that present butch and act excessively or performatively masculine. These are just clothing and behavior by themselves and not inherently sexual imo. \\n\\nI\'m personally not a fan of these types of functions (drag queen story hour,) because it just seems weird on the surface to me. The justification is it\'s supposed to help kids be more tolerant of people different from them. I just think most people get the basis of their values from their parents (either directly, by extrapolating or abstracting or in derision of their parents failings,) so just raise your kids to be tolerant of other people. Like the most transphobic people I meet probably absorbed all their bigotry from their environment. Like today I got called the f slur for gays for...working. that\'s right all I did was my job and some guys took some weird fuckin issue with me just existing. Do you think if you had sat them down for drag queen story hour as kids they\'d be more tolerant? Not while their parents and friends and stuff are the opposite. Maybe the exposure to such a thing would make them less alarmed at the sight of it but I don\'t think it would fix the underlying issue. \\n\\nAnd if we had that in a school here there would be protests worse than the antivaxxers outside of mercy/cox.

Mark Morris Dance Center and Broadway Dance Center have Absolute Beginner workshops for adults on a seasonal basis - check if they have any coming up for Contemporary or Tap. \\\\*\\n\\nNote that there are different styles of contemporary - there\'s commercial, modern-based, contemporary floor work, release technique and more. It\'s not uniform so the style you\'re getting is dependent on the instructor and studio. Broadway Dance Center tends to be on the commercial side and skews younger. Other studios like Peridance and Gibney are far less commercial in style. \\n\\nSteps on Broadway is probably the best studio in the city for Tap (in addition to Jazz, and Musical Theater). I\'d recommend looking there. Steps might also have Absolute Beginner workshops for adults.\\n\\nIf you\'re into Merce Cunningham, consider looking into Modern dance classes like Graham technique (Merce danced with Martha Graham before he formed his own company). Members of Merce\'s company used to teach professional level classes at City Center but these are no more from what I\'ve heard.
