Also big news, we found out we\xe2\x80\x99re having a girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers.

Look at the heat with Ray Allen.

It\'s annoying how contending teams can just strengthen themselves on a cheap by signing recently bough out vets. I argue that the Heat only won its second championship cause of this.

I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son.

I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

It is basic manners to 1. Let someone know ahead of time if you won\'t be on time for dinner and 2. Not complain or whine about the food needing reheating and going rubbery because she decided not to be at dinner and 3. Not complain or whine because she had to put a fully prepared dinner in the oven to cook because she didn\'t turn up for dinner.\\n\\nRight now, she is showing you how she will handle conflict. And it would seem she handles conflict by blaming and attacking you for her lack of communication and manners.  Seriously, it is really not hard to make a call saying \\"I am going to be late, please cook my meal and I will heat it up\\" or \\"I am going to be late. Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner. It will actually tell you a lot about your future relationship whether she apologises and negotiates with you how to handle being late or doubles down and continues to treat you like an errant servant.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

It is basic manners to 1. Let someone know ahead of time if you won\'t be on time for dinner and 2. Not complain or whine about the food needing reheating and going rubbery because she decided not to be at dinner and 3. Not complain or whine because she had to put a fully prepared dinner in the oven to cook because she didn\'t turn up for dinner.\\n\\nRight now, she is showing you how she will handle conflict. And it would seem she handles conflict by blaming and attacking you for her lack of communication and manners.  Seriously, it is really not hard to make a call saying \\"I am going to be late, please cook my meal and I will heat it up\\" or \\"I am going to be late. Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner. It will actually tell you a lot about your future relationship whether she apologises and negotiates with you how to handle being late or doubles down and continues to treat you like an errant servant.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

It is basic manners to 1. Let someone know ahead of time if you won\'t be on time for dinner and 2. Not complain or whine about the food needing reheating and going rubbery because she decided not to be at dinner and 3. Not complain or whine because she had to put a fully prepared dinner in the oven to cook because she didn\'t turn up for dinner.\\n\\nRight now, she is showing you how she will handle conflict. And it would seem she handles conflict by blaming and attacking you for her lack of communication and manners.  Seriously, it is really not hard to make a call saying \\"I am going to be late, please cook my meal and I will heat it up\\" or \\"I am going to be late. Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner. It will actually tell you a lot about your future relationship whether she apologises and negotiates with you how to handle being late or doubles down and continues to treat you like an errant servant.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.

Please leave my meal and I will cook it later\\". I would be sitting her down and coming to an agreement on how to handle when someone won\'t be there for dinner. I would also point out to her that her accusations were unfair and hurtful, and you would like an apology. This is a really minor conflict with some pretty easy solutions if you respect your partner.

This article overtly lied about the summer demand. At peak load last summer, wind spent the vast majority of its time at &lt;20%. In 2021, natgas was being used to heat homes as well as run the grid, and when solar reached 0% and wind reached sub 10% capacity, dispatchable energy sources couldn\'t meet the capacity. This will continue to be a problem until there is either sufficient grid storage, or a dramatically lower dependency on solar/wind. Presumably, these severe weather events will become more commonplace. Long stretches, potentially up to a week or more, where an arctic blast could completely eliminate solar production, as well as reduce wind output to 10% or less. 75-85GW load for a week straight would require literally trillions of dollars worth of battery backup if NREL estimates are to be believed, and those costs have very likely increased in the past two years.

And yes, if you compare the universe to a human life, the universe has just come out of the womb and hasn\'t even taken its first blink. 13.6 billion years is laughably microscopic to how much longer the universe will last. I will not give you an exact number as it\'s beyond human comprehension of how large that number is. But I will give you an idea of that scale. \\n\\nEven if humans were to extend their survival to as far as they can travelling beyond our own star and surviving to be an advanced futuristic civilization... We will still occupy an island in the vast ocean of time. \\n\\nThere are many theories on how the universe will reach its end. In all the matter that is present in the universe it has to decay. Right now so close to its birth there is a lot of colourful matter on different forms allowing the formation of complex molecules which enables life to exist. \\n\\nEventually all the stars will run out of energy and die out. Large supergiant stars burn very quickly and die out within 5 to 10 million years. An average sized star like our sun burns put in about 10 to 15 billion years. Red dwarfs will take trillions of years to finally use up all their energy. That is a very very long time compared to a billion. But then we look at neutron stars which are made of matter crushed together so much that it is degenerative. It will take around 10000000000 years for a neutron star to completely die out and stop emitting light. This is still a miniscule amount of time when you compare it to how long the universe will last. \\n\\nAll reasonable matter that you and I will ever see in our lives has died out. All that\'s left is matter left in black holes. Most of the universe\'s life is spent with only black holes existing. And black holes will also eventually decay. But this will take a very very very looong time. It will take an average black hole about 10\xe2\x81\xb6\xe2\x81\xb4 years to completely decays into radiation leaving no matter behind. That is 1 followed by 64 zeros. So if a black hole was created right at the start of the universe, at present day it has lived only for 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % of its lifetime.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories of how it will end after this. One of the well established theories is the heat death of the universe. Eventually there will be no matter left and all there will be is radiation. The universe will keep expanding as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is the heat death of the universe. It will die slowly, very slowly in the cold. The universe will reach an equilibrium, or the most disordered (highest entropy) state it can reach and there will be no change. With no change there is no more time. With no more time there is no more space. The Universe will remain this instant forever (technically not forever, because time is meaningless at this point lol).","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_130on2j","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/130on2j/a_23yearold_woman_caught_in_the_eruption_of_mount/ji0ibih/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654879,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Damnthatsinteresting","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654894,"updated_utc":1682654894,"body_sha1":"a1304a94e95a8a045511706e96d064e296e7434f","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:59"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_33a94","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"MyTeam","author_flair_template_id":"a42888c8-93bc-11ea-969b-0e8f4064022d","id":"ji0iayx","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"kyrobe2021","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447681733,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_a1s7mmj5","all_awardings":[],"body":"Heat should\xe2\x80\x99ve been swept by the Bucks.

There should be no way the most expensive roster in clippers should be able to add a talent like westbrook on a really really cheap contract.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1313pz5","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/warriors/comments/1313pz5/nba_adam_silver_and_co_are_idiots_for_penalizing/ji0i9dl/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654844,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/warriors","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654857,"updated_utc":1682654858,"body_sha1":"01e5a8d3bbb4c04de2dca901a4428e6a6f351713","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:07:24"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjw5","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Thailand","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0i9ci","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"viola-blast","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42443000772,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_w2j9glg5","all_awardings":[],"body":"All the Thai people I know in the USA are in no hurry to return.

There are many who will want you to sell something too low in price for you to be interested in. I think there\'s a place for you to offer a line in the range of $1000-3000 with options. You could sell both barebones chassis and complete systems.

Bro you can\xe2\x80\x99t even find no games with those places in games today without some crazy ass off the wall mods. All the Real drag tracks we got to take passes in. Also, the environment and game/commentators made you feel like you were actually doing something within the career. Like man I feel like we have gotten used to such shit games we just eat everything thing up that is thrown at us. Before those games felt like were made by dudes who genuinely liked cars and being around them. Or had some sort of background with cars. Today They just mash some bullshit together, give it some good graphics and boom! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d game.

These scrambled proteins get tangled up in the kappa casein \\"hairs\\" on the casein micelles.  You can still easily make an acid coagulated curd from this milk, but the scrambled proteins caught up in the kappa casein will hold a lot of water.  This is why if you scald your milk (or use UHT milk) when making yogurt, it will be very thick.  It also means that if you try to drain acid formed curds made with UHT (or scalded) milk, it takes an age.\\n\\nFor rennet formed curds, if you heat the milk too high, the scrabled proteins will physically block access to the kappa casein.  This will mean that the rennet can\'t cut the kappa casein off and you can not form a rennet curd.  This is why we must use pasteurised or raw milk for making rennet formed curds.  UHT milk can not work.\\n\\nAdditionally, homogenised milk is made by bursting the fat globules in the milk.  This causes fat to coat coat and stick to the casein micelles.  That\'s great for stopping it from floating to the surface of the milk, but terrible for forming a rennet curd.  Again, the fat physically blocks access to the kappa casein.  In this case, it tends to only block it a bit, so you can still form a curd, but it will be very weak and will fracture very easily.  Instead of each casein micelle having many links to other casein micelles, there are only a few.\\n\\nWhen making rennet based curds we really want to use unhomogenised, pasteurised (or ideally raw) milk.  This forms the best curd.\\n\\nFor acid formed curds, homogenisation makes no difference at all to us (and actually it\'s kind of convenient because it holds the fat in place).  UHT or scalded milk will hold more water so it\'s inconvenient to drain sometimes (depending on the type of cheese you are making), but you can often work around that problem.  For reasons I won\'t get into (requiring a similarly long post), you can\'t make a cheese that melts if you use UHT or scalded milk.  So if melting is important to you, then you must use pasteurised or raw milk (raw milk is much less important here than with rennet based cheeses)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fznt","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/cheesemaking/comments/131fznt/i_keep_reading_that_both_acid_and_rennet_curdles/ji0hmqv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654480,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/cheesemaking","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654494,"updated_utc":1682654495,"body_sha1":"c887121f7bdb83073c6a4a6c61cada929f96f325","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:20"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2u0zn","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"adhdmeme","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0hmcf","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"alsoaprettybigdeal","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_h1c26","all_awardings":[],"body":"I can smell when something IS hot, but the small of heat itself changes for me.

You mentioned that she does most of the chores and childcare, and that you have demanding children, so she\'s probably touched out, burnt out, and in dire need of someone to give her a break. She asked you to make her some noodles-- why didn\'t you just get the water in the pan and turn on the heat? Or throw them in the microwave, if that\'s how they\'re prepared, and *then* go in for kisses and cuddles? To her, it likely seemed like you were ignoring her request in favor of trying to get some action. Touched out, burnt out moms do **NOT** like this, at all. Even if that\'s not what you were doing, that\'s how it reads. Nothing will enrage a tired mom more than having her words or needs ignored while her husband tries to get in her pants.  What stay at home moms need most, when the kids are that young and all-consuming, is space, quiet, and... food (that they don\'t have to work for or clean up after). The love comes *after* she\'s had some time to breathe and reset. Try to push things before then, and, well...chips get thrown. Seriously though, her reaction was childish, but aren\'t we all, at times? Perhaps she has a problem apologizing because she feels as though you were wrong as well.... which, you were. One of you needs to extend an \\"olive branch\\" and say you\'re sorry first. Doesn\'t matter who-- you were both wrong. But perhaps her reaction would not have happened or been so immature, if she felt like you cared more about her than your penis. It\'s a common mistake, made by many a man who\'s love language is touch. It\'s not entirely your fault, you\'re wired this way, **but** you need to be more aware of your partner\'s feelings and when it\'s appropriate to ask them to speak your language (when they\'ll be most receptive), **and** what their love language is.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131effw","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/relationship_advice/comments/131effw/my_m34_wife_f33_got_mad_at_me_for_not_making_her/ji0hlsd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Late 30s Female","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationship_advice","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"b7f83c78e6bfdba665b646da8fb60e32a2ec4332","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

This at first glance seems cynical, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek to condemn said flaws; instead, he depicts them as part of the human condition and portrays his flawed protagonists with sympathy and humour. Even the most flawed of his protagonists have traits that humanise them, and more often than not, they\xe2\x80\x99re offered a chance at redemption, or at least a respite by the time the film ends. And what better film encapsulates this theme than \xe2\x80\x98Some Like it Hot\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s got everything \xe2\x80\x94 humour, an acceptance of human faults and failings, and of course, that immortal final line which just sums up Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life philosophy. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s got Marilyn Monroe. What more could a film have?\\nHonourable Mention: The Apartment\\n\\nMagnum Opus: Sunset Boulevard \\nI know that Sunset Boulevard could easily function as an intro flick as well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to sympathise with two musicians running away from the mafia than any of the deeply, deeply flawed characters here. But that just makes it all the more perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s noirs, I think. Compared to other noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Laura, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story from a detective\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. He takes the perspective of the people in the heat of the action. There is no conspiracy to uncover, no murder to solve. The people directly involved will give it to you straight. And Sunset Boulevard is no exception. It has humour, it has pizazz, and it has deeply flawed characters. It\xe2\x80\x99s quintessential Wilder.\\nHonourable Mention: Double Indemnity \\n\\nCurio: One, Two, Three\\nPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t usually rank it that highly on \xe2\x80\x98Best of\xe2\x80\x99 lists, but I prefer it over Sabrina (gasp!). James Cagney chews the scenery, vomits it back out, and chews it up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s Fawlty Towers before Fawlty Towers. And as always, it\xe2\x80\x99s got humour and flawed protagonists.\\nHonourable mention: Kiss Me, Stupid","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_13163la","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/Letterboxd/comments/13163la/for_your_favorite_director_pick_three_of_their/ji0h7uf/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654245,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Letterboxd","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654263,"updated_utc":1682654263,"body_sha1":"2dc2ea27378164c2fb0edaf8d34af672f2f5b69d","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:57:25"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2si7q","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"ebikes","author_flair_template_id":"d97259fe-9c4d-11e8-88d1-0ed62ea78c7c","id":"ji0h7bo","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Bengy222","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447662936,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_d7qvmx","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yes, most (if not all) diy mid drives come with one.
