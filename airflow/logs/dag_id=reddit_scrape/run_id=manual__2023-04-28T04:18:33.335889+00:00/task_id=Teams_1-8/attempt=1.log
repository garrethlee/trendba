Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0jaac","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"LebrontosaurausRex","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447967785,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_836cgyl8","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yo this is the man we watched cook Jrue for 48 in an eastern conference finals, he then went on to turn his ankle. We didn\'t have Hunter that entire post season besides a couple of Knicks games. The entire case against Trae is the Miami series when he didn\'t have a secondary playmaker against a team that loads up on the strong side passing lanes, how TF is that his fault?\\n\\n\\n I\'m not trying to shit on Hunter and Collins but they just are not talented enough to be starters on a championship team and you certainly can\'t make it there with both of them starting. Not saying they wouldn\'t be a good 5th starter or 7th man but damn it sucks when they are your 3rd and 4th option and realize you can\'t keep Okongwu if you keep them and Dejounte. \\n\\nAlso Nate Macmillan was a fucking trainwreck and I was pissed when we extended him when he made it there on LP\'s offense. He then installed the same offense that limited some really decent pacers teams and wasted the 3-5th best high volume decision maker currently playing basketball. Did he have an offense which used off ball movement to make passing lanes easier on a 6\'0\\" guy? Nope he sure fucking didn\'t, unless you think curling hunter into midrange jumpers at the elbow 7 seconds into the shot clock qualifies as unclogging the middle of the floor. I don\'t watch every team but I sure as hell watch enough hawks to tell you that Trae fucking carried this team, and I\'m pretty sure the \\"coach killer\\" and \\"losing ball player\\" narratives only started cause Lloyd Pierce and Nate always would give interviews and be down for long form pieces. ( I think Zach Lowe or Baxter Holmes had a piece that talked about Lloyd bringing the baby hawks to playoff games as evidence that he was coaching the right way). \\n\\nIt\'s ok to say hey I don\'t watch enough to be informed on this team no shame in that. I certainly haven\'t watched enough Ivey, Duran or Cade to have an opinion yet.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fomg","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/131fomg/the_atlanta_hawks_have_been_eliminated_from/ji0jaac/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655472,"updated_utc":1682655473,"body_sha1":"1d4b3e2f51a022dbe06ed87c4927b18fcd486891","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:38"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2sgwl","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"AtlantaHawks","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0j5n6","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"gmzeno","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_20w6h188","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your Hawks season ends with a loss to the Boston Celtics 120-128.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not too upset but it\'s still kind of annoying because we could have won this. I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create. I felt he was kind of indecisive, an example being his taking too long to put the ball on the ground when the shot clock was under 10 seconds. Overall it was a meh game. D+.

I was responsible for that bit of back and forth with the screenshots from each other\'s sub before game 1 how \\"Hawks have beaten us once in 64 years\\" and I was completely dismissing you guys. It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great. Hopefully Quin turns it around for you guys and I\'ll be looking forward to rooting for you in future series if it\'s as a neutral fan.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0g9wy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682653730,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682653747,"updated_utc":1682653747,"body_sha1":"320703cb412dfd13c52b4b01d536b9ebe956e372","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:48:50"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nfl","author_flair_template_id":"196494d0-0f94-11eb-8680-0ece8d346439","id":"ji0g9gv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"JuanPicasso","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_jpxr3zp","all_awardings":[],"body":"Damn they\xe2\x80\x99re already the final boss of the nfc.

Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0jaac","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"LebrontosaurausRex","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447967785,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_836cgyl8","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yo this is the man we watched cook Jrue for 48 in an eastern conference finals, he then went on to turn his ankle.

The entire case against Trae is the Miami series when he didn\'t have a secondary playmaker against a team that loads up on the strong side passing lanes, how TF is that his fault?\\n\\n\\n I\'m not trying to shit on Hunter and Collins but they just are not talented enough to be starters on a championship team and you certainly can\'t make it there with both of them starting. Not saying they wouldn\'t be a good 5th starter or 7th man but damn it sucks when they are your 3rd and 4th option and realize you can\'t keep Okongwu if you keep them and Dejounte. \\n\\nAlso Nate Macmillan was a fucking trainwreck and I was pissed when we extended him when he made it there on LP\'s offense. He then installed the same offense that limited some really decent pacers teams and wasted the 3-5th best high volume decision maker currently playing basketball.

Nope he sure fucking didn\'t, unless you think curling hunter into midrange jumpers at the elbow 7 seconds into the shot clock qualifies as unclogging the middle of the floor. I don\'t watch every team but I sure as hell watch enough hawks to tell you that Trae fucking carried this team, and I\'m pretty sure the \\"coach killer\\" and \\"losing ball player\\" narratives only started cause Lloyd Pierce and Nate always would give interviews and be down for long form pieces.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create. I felt he was kind of indecisive, an example being his taking too long to put the ball on the ground when the shot clock was under 10 seconds. Overall it was a meh game. D+.

I was responsible for that bit of back and forth with the screenshots from each other\'s sub before game 1 how \\"Hawks have beaten us once in 64 years\\" and I was completely dismissing you guys. It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great. Hopefully Quin turns it around for you guys and I\'ll be looking forward to rooting for you in future series if it\'s as a neutral fan.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0g9wy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682653730,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682653747,"updated_utc":1682653747,"body_sha1":"320703cb412dfd13c52b4b01d536b9ebe956e372","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:48:50"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nfl","author_flair_template_id":"196494d0-0f94-11eb-8680-0ece8d346439","id":"ji0g9gv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"JuanPicasso","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_jpxr3zp","all_awardings":[],"body":"Damn they\xe2\x80\x99re already the final boss of the nfc.

Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0jaac","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"LebrontosaurausRex","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447967785,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_836cgyl8","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yo this is the man we watched cook Jrue for 48 in an eastern conference finals, he then went on to turn his ankle.

Not saying they wouldn\'t be a good 5th starter or 7th man but damn it sucks when they are your 3rd and 4th option and realize you can\'t keep Okongwu if you keep them and Dejounte. \\n\\nAlso Nate Macmillan was a fucking trainwreck and I was pissed when we extended him when he made it there on LP\'s offense. He then installed the same offense that limited some really decent pacers teams and wasted the 3-5th best high volume decision maker currently playing basketball.

Nope he sure fucking didn\'t, unless you think curling hunter into midrange jumpers at the elbow 7 seconds into the shot clock qualifies as unclogging the middle of the floor. I don\'t watch every team but I sure as hell watch enough hawks to tell you that Trae fucking carried this team, and I\'m pretty sure the \\"coach killer\\" and \\"losing ball player\\" narratives only started cause Lloyd Pierce and Nate always would give interviews and be down for long form pieces.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create. I felt he was kind of indecisive, an example being his taking too long to put the ball on the ground when the shot clock was under 10 seconds. Overall it was a meh game. D+.

I was responsible for that bit of back and forth with the screenshots from each other\'s sub before game 1 how \\"Hawks have beaten us once in 64 years\\" and I was completely dismissing you guys. It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great. Hopefully Quin turns it around for you guys and I\'ll be looking forward to rooting for you in future series if it\'s as a neutral fan.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0g9wy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682653730,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682653747,"updated_utc":1682653747,"body_sha1":"320703cb412dfd13c52b4b01d536b9ebe956e372","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:48:50"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nfl","author_flair_template_id":"196494d0-0f94-11eb-8680-0ece8d346439","id":"ji0g9gv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"JuanPicasso","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_jpxr3zp","all_awardings":[],"body":"Damn they\xe2\x80\x99re already the final boss of the nfc.

Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0jaac","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"LebrontosaurausRex","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447967785,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_836cgyl8","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yo this is the man we watched cook Jrue for 48 in an eastern conference finals, he then went on to turn his ankle.

The entire case against Trae is the Miami series when he didn\'t have a secondary playmaker against a team that loads up on the strong side passing lanes, how TF is that his fault?\\n\\n\\n I\'m not trying to shit on Hunter and Collins but they just are not talented enough to be starters on a championship team and you certainly can\'t make it there with both of them starting. Not saying they wouldn\'t be a good 5th starter or 7th man but damn it sucks when they are your 3rd and 4th option and realize you can\'t keep Okongwu if you keep them and Dejounte. \\n\\nAlso Nate Macmillan was a fucking trainwreck and I was pissed when we extended him when he made it there on LP\'s offense. He then installed the same offense that limited some really decent pacers teams and wasted the 3-5th best high volume decision maker currently playing basketball.

Nope he sure fucking didn\'t, unless you think curling hunter into midrange jumpers at the elbow 7 seconds into the shot clock qualifies as unclogging the middle of the floor. I don\'t watch every team but I sure as hell watch enough hawks to tell you that Trae fucking carried this team, and I\'m pretty sure the \\"coach killer\\" and \\"losing ball player\\" narratives only started cause Lloyd Pierce and Nate always would give interviews and be down for long form pieces.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create. I felt he was kind of indecisive, an example being his taking too long to put the ball on the ground when the shot clock was under 10 seconds. Overall it was a meh game. D+.

I was responsible for that bit of back and forth with the screenshots from each other\'s sub before game 1 how \\"Hawks have beaten us once in 64 years\\" and I was completely dismissing you guys. It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great. Hopefully Quin turns it around for you guys and I\'ll be looking forward to rooting for you in future series if it\'s as a neutral fan.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0g9wy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682653730,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682653747,"updated_utc":1682653747,"body_sha1":"320703cb412dfd13c52b4b01d536b9ebe956e372","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:48:50"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nfl","author_flair_template_id":"196494d0-0f94-11eb-8680-0ece8d346439","id":"ji0g9gv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"JuanPicasso","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_jpxr3zp","all_awardings":[],"body":"Damn they\xe2\x80\x99re already the final boss of the nfc.

Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0jaac","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"LebrontosaurausRex","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447967785,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_836cgyl8","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yo this is the man we watched cook Jrue for 48 in an eastern conference finals, he then went on to turn his ankle.

The entire case against Trae is the Miami series when he didn\'t have a secondary playmaker against a team that loads up on the strong side passing lanes, how TF is that his fault?\\n\\n\\n I\'m not trying to shit on Hunter and Collins but they just are not talented enough to be starters on a championship team and you certainly can\'t make it there with both of them starting. Not saying they wouldn\'t be a good 5th starter or 7th man but damn it sucks when they are your 3rd and 4th option and realize you can\'t keep Okongwu if you keep them and Dejounte. \\n\\nAlso Nate Macmillan was a fucking trainwreck and I was pissed when we extended him when he made it there on LP\'s offense. He then installed the same offense that limited some really decent pacers teams and wasted the 3-5th best high volume decision maker currently playing basketball.

Nope he sure fucking didn\'t, unless you think curling hunter into midrange jumpers at the elbow 7 seconds into the shot clock qualifies as unclogging the middle of the floor. I don\'t watch every team but I sure as hell watch enough hawks to tell you that Trae fucking carried this team, and I\'m pretty sure the \\"coach killer\\" and \\"losing ball player\\" narratives only started cause Lloyd Pierce and Nate always would give interviews and be down for long form pieces.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create.

I was responsible for that bit of back and forth with the screenshots from each other\'s sub before game 1 how \\"Hawks have beaten us once in 64 years\\" and I was completely dismissing you guys. It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great. Hopefully Quin turns it around for you guys and I\'ll be looking forward to rooting for you in future series if it\'s as a neutral fan.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0g9wy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682653730,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682653747,"updated_utc":1682653747,"body_sha1":"320703cb412dfd13c52b4b01d536b9ebe956e372","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:48:50"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nfl","author_flair_template_id":"196494d0-0f94-11eb-8680-0ece8d346439","id":"ji0g9gv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"JuanPicasso","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_jpxr3zp","all_awardings":[],"body":"Damn they\xe2\x80\x99re already the final boss of the nfc.

Bogi started off the second quarter with an airball three. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater. With under 8 he hit a beautiful crossover and made a contested layup. With under 3, Bogi got in his dribble bag and got to the rim for a finger roll over 2-3 people. With under a minute he drove through the defense and got a layup. With around 39 seconds left in the game, Bogi shot a wild three with two people on him and got a foul. Unfortunately only hit one free throw. I thought he was good off the bench providing microwave scoring whenever we needed it. B+ tonight. For the series, I think he was pretty solid in most of the games. B+.\\n\\nJalen had 5 points on 2/2 shooting in 5 minutes. Jalen started the second quarter with an open three. With around 7, Murray got the ball to Jalen in transition and he made a reverse layup forcing a Celtic timeout. For the series, he had multiple good moments, that said his shooting cost the team at times because the Celtics were almost giving him the Ben Simmons treatment not guarding him. Defensively, he had trouble with quicker players when he was forced to guard the perimeter.  Hopefully, the series gives him a good idea of what to work on in the offseason. B- for the series.\\n\\nMurray could have been better tonight. With under 10 in the second Murray nearly had a turnover but he got the ball back on a bad Celtic pass and found Bogi who drained the three. Murray got his first points in the third with a mid-range over Horford. With under 8, Murray drew a foul on Brown on a layup attempt. Trae had a quick pass up the court and Murray was able to get to the rim before the Celtics defense got back and got a foul. With under 4 he navigated the screen and was able to get to his spot for a midrange bucket. To start the fourth with under 9 Murray got to a floater driving against White. With under two Murray hit a three to put the Hawks down 5. Murray ended with 14 points, 7 rebounds, 11 assists, and 1 steal on 5/13 shooting. He did most of his damage in the second half going \xe2\x85\x9d. Defensively he had trouble once again guarding Jalen Brown. Playmaking was excellent with only one turnover. I just wish he was more aggressive to start the game. We needed 25 from him tonight. C+ for DJM. For his series grade, he was sitting at an A- before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game. But due to his suspension, which could have been easily avoided,  I have to knock off a little more than a full letter grade. Then you add on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game and I have to give him a C for the series.\\n\\nOO was solid, especially defensively. With under 9 in the second OO got in a good position in the post. He got the ball and missed a lightly contested dunk. Luckily he got an offensive rebound and put it back in. With under 8, he hit a turnaround hook thanks to a Bogi pass. With around 3, he had a crazy block on a Tatum pass from the three-point line. With under a minute in the third, OO got a putback off a Trae miss and got an and-1. He missed the free throw, unfortunately. With under 9  in the fourth, Trae threw a lob that was almost too high but OO got it and drew a foul on Williams. OO ended with 6 points, 11 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks. I think this may have been his best game of the series with his rebounding and defense. B for OO. For the series he averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds which is kind of meh in my opinion. His defense was his best trait as his versatility got him more playing time than Clint in some games. That said I expect a little more from him if he is going to be a starter long term. C+ for the series. \\n\\nIt was definitely a roller coaster of a season with many ups, downs and a new coach. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see what Quin can implement going into next season. That said our problems do not come purely from coaching and it\'s partially a roster issue. Good luck to Landry Fields and Kyle Korver because they\'ll have a lot of tough choices to make regarding free agency, trading certain players, and the draft. I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget the luxury tax and whether or not our owner will want to dip into it.  Last review of the season. Thanks, Hawks fam for reading and supporting these! I hope to do more next season.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0jazs/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655469,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655487,"updated_utc":1682655488,"body_sha1":"2f86b178026807cef2f887836b397ce56b0fe34e","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:17:49"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":"ba3f0082-3feb-11e8-a776-0e591d7ca058","id":"ji0j721","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"FerdinandMagellan999","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447753737,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_5z2wkfig","all_awardings":[],"body":"Celtics lost a game to the rockets like 7 weeks ago.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be adding some grades for the player\xe2\x80\x99s series along with their usual game rating.\\n\\nTrae was good\xe2\x80\xa6in the first half. The first offensive possession was a scramble. Trae tried to throw a pass on to JC but it nearly got picked off. The ball was saved and Trae tried to throw a lob to a cutting JC and that got picked off for a turnover. With under 7 in the first he was able to get an And-1 floater, getting a switch against Horford. With around 5, Trae had an insane three over Marcus Smart. It looked like the Jordan Jumpman logo when he was in mid-air. With under 2, Trae hit a step-back three over Brogdon. On defense, he drew an offensive foul on White. The next possession he drew another foul on a floater attempt and made both. He did a Lebron-style step back and splashed another long-distance three. Trae was insane playing the whole first quarter and scoring 18 points on 5/10 shooting and 3/6 from three. I thought Trae was going to drop 40+ tonight.  Even with his efforts the Hawks were still down one going into the second quarter. With under 7 in the second he used the screen and made a midrange jumper over Horford. With around 4, he hit another step back three from the wing over Smart. At around three minutes they ran a double screen for Trae allowing him to go downhill and find a cutting Capela for a lob. With under a minute he drove from the wing and got a floater to go in. With under 30 he drove once again and made a tricky pass ( I think the ball went under Brown\'s legs) to JC who drained the three. Trae was A++ in the first half scoring 25 points and 4 assists on 8/15 shooting including 4/8 from three. For context, Murray had 0 points by half. With around 8 in the third, Trae hit a floater over Horford and drew a flagrant foul as Horford came into Trae\'s landing space. Yea. The only shot he hit in the 2nd half and Trae went 1/13(!!!!) in the second half including 4 missed threes. His takeover meter ran out hard. Trae ended with 30 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists, 1 steal, and 2 rebounds on 9/28 shots (32%) and 4/12 (33%) from three. In conclusion, it was a tale of two halves with the first half being an A+ and the second half being an F. Playmaking was average tonight with 5 turnovers to go with his 10 assists. Defensively, I thought Trae made plenty of effort tonight running around the court and he even got a block on both Brown and Tatum. Trae got a better whistle tonight and went 8/8 at the line. We were in the game at halftime because of Trae but part of the reason we lost is because he couldn\'t hit the shots he normally makes in the second half. Because of this, I have no other choice but to give Trae a C tonight. For the series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a B- to B.\\n\\nHunter did exactly what we needed him to do. Hunter got his first shot blocked by Horford with under 9 in the first. The next possession he was able to get a floater to go in. He missed an open three on the next possession. With around 4, Hunter got to the paint and missed a relatively easy layup. Luckily he got the offensive rebound and putback. With under 3, He threw a nice kick-out pass to Bey who drilled a three. Hunter started the third with an off-the-dribble three. With around 8 Hunter hit his second three of the quarter. With under 6, he made a wide-open three off a PNR with Trae. With under 2 he cut to the rim and received a pass from Murray who had gotten an offensive rebound. With 19 seconds in the game, he had a bad turnover on the inbounds pass. Like it went across the court and nobody could get it. Hunter ended with 20 points, 6 rebounds, assist, 1 steal, and 1 block on a meh 7/17 shooting. That said I felt he hit timely shots and I didn\'t know the efficiency was that \xe2\x80\x9cmeh\xe2\x80\x9d until I saw the box score. Defensively I thought this was one of his better games. He didn\'t get blown by constantly like earlier in the series. 6 rebounds are perfect for Hunter. B+. For the whole series, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a C.\\n\\nCapela was fine and got 10 points and 10 rebounds and 2 assists on 5/7 shooting. Capela got to the offensive glass early and made a putback. With under 8 in the first, Trae found him for a lob. With around 4 in the third Capela had a putback off a Saddiq miss. He was great on the offensive boards with 5. Defensively, he was about average. For this game I\'ll give him a B-. Throughout the series, he got outplayed by Horford and even Robert Williams at times. He is not as good when playing a center that can stretch the floor. For the series, ill give him a C.\\n\\nJohn Collins was good tonight. With around 7, JC had a steal in the paint against Jalen Brown. This led to a break opportunity and a Trae-drawn foul. With under 5, he drove to the paint and had an insane spin move and reverse layup over the defense. With under 5 in the second quarter, he buried a three. JC was the second leading scorer for the Hawks by half scoring 9 points on 3\xe2\x81\x844 shooting and 2\xe2\x81\x843 from three. JC started the third with a nice contest in Brown forcing him to pass to Horford mid-shot. He was also able to stop White from getting to the rim and forced him to pass out. He had another good defensive stop on Brown recovering nicely on a step back forcing him to pass. To start the 4th he had a bad pass leading to a turnover. He made up for it on the next possession with a floater of a pick-and-pop. With under 10, he got called for an offensive foul when he drove in on Grant and attempted a spin move. With around 8 he hit a three-off a Trae pick and pop. With around 7 Murray fed JC in the paint and he was able to take advantage and hit a turnaround floater. JC ended the game with 16 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 2 blocks on 6/8 shooting and 3\xe2\x81\x844 from three. Defensively, he was pretty good on Jalen Brown and was top 2 on him the whole series. Rebounding was kinda low for not only this game but the whole series. A- for tonight. C for the whole series.\\n\\nBey had 7 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal on 2/7 shooting and \xc2\xbd from three. With under 4 Bey got to the paint spinning for a shot that missed. He hustled, grabbed his miss and got a foul out of it. With under 3, he had a steal on Tatum but missed the shot in the break. With under 6 in the second he drove on Brogdon and made a fading midrange off the move. Not only was he inefficient, I thought he was kind of passive tonight. A few times Trae would pass him and pass and he would pass it right back for him to create. I felt he was kind of indecisive, an example being his taking too long to put the ball on the ground when the shot clock was under 10 seconds. Overall it was a meh game. D+. For the series, I think he was decent. B-.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131fnsh","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/131fnsh/post_game_thread_the_boston_celtics_defeat_the/ji0j5n6/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655379,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/AtlantaHawks","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655392,"updated_utc":1682655393,"body_sha1":"2a18f8d660569f12e4041168d27504ec7e031a02","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:16:19"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s1w0","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"panthers","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0j2mb","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"captaincumsock69","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447620790,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_3xeb4y8a","all_awardings":[],"body":"I\xe2\x80\x99m a panthers Celtics fan so I almost died of a heart attack today lol","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131c99n","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/panthers/comments/131c99n/with_the_1_overall_pick_of_the_2023_nfl_draft_the/ji0j2mb/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682655330,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/panthers","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682655346,"updated_utc":1682655347,"body_sha1":"c1b1a10d8ae9a66325e3b25c110adce1249d8c57","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:15:30"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2scmr","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"sixers","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0j15a","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"keystothemoon","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_7h3wl","all_awardings":[],"body":"My cuz married a dude from beantown when she moved up there years ago.

Also big news, we found out we\xe2\x80\x99re having a girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers.
