I\'ve never had a cat who loves being under the covers.\\n\\nWho are these characters you\'re talking about, you ask? Probably not but I\'ll do my spiel anyways! Please read [The Demon in Shadow!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-utFIYKm01e-xYdXfUMatPCuHeOfIICka2NZOJDpls/edit?usp=sharing) It\'s a full novel by myself about a human and demon who get caught up in each other\'s problems and become closer for it. It\'s set in an original world and made in such a way that you\'re learning about how things work alongside demon deuteragonist Ayun. And it\'s got amazing artwork in the back that I\'ve comissioned that gain more context when you read the thang ding.\\n\\nAfter last week\'s departure it\'s time to get back into the backlog. A kit that\'s been sitting in my stash for a while is [the Rune God Rayearth from the titular series Magic Knight Rayearth!](https://imgur.com/a/8NfVGAL) It\'s a pretty recent release from Goodsmile, syncing up nicely with them showing up in SRW 30... Even if they technically debuted in T. It doesn\'t have dual language, but it comes with a fully colored manual that is very good at pointing out how things need to be set in and work. It also has a good amount of pre-painted parts like the face and sword. Its articulation is a little stiff, which isn\'t helped by things like the skirt but I still think it looks great. Has enough hands to make fun poses and the flame effects on the wings are dope. Selece and Windam are waiting in the wings, so it will be great to have them all in one shot. \\n\\nSide note, the series is on Amazon Prime, dubbed and subbed? The dub isn\'t too bad, but the video quality is pretty bad. I guess it fits that 90s vibe? But I can\'t help but think there are much better transfers on the high seas. I mean, that Nadia one I found is GORGEOUS and that show came out five years prior to Rayearth. \\n\\nI was going to save this one for a rainy day, but neither this or the Rayearth shoots had a lot of content.

I thought about going Space Wolves like the actual units I used to have somewhere, but this was part of a sale on USAG and the dogs were already sold out. For an action figure, this thing has a lot of good points going for it. Great articulation (except for one part we\'ll get to), good detailing, and even not on sale 40 bucks isn\'t bad at all. What does kill me about this thing are the hands. Not a lack of them, but the joints themselves. For some unknown reason, the wrists connect at two points. But the one that connects to the hand is super tight. To the point I had to bust out pliers in fear of dislodging a nail. And then fearing that trying to separate these pieces would just snap the joint altogether. Not fun. That\'s why there\'s a lot less shots, even though it comes with some cool hands. The other thing is that because of those beefy pauldrons, action poses aren\'t easy. Dynamic ones are perfect. Hold the gun up, rest the chainsword on your shoulder no problem. But aiming the gun might as well look like a Gundam kit from the 80s. You can remove the shoulders, but it doesn\'t really fix that problem. I think if they get rid of the stupid hand garbage it would be an easy recommendation from me. But as it stands, maybe get one you like and never change their weapons.\\n\\nI fell back into Fallout 4 for a minute, but I feel like even with some good mods I had scraped that rock clean. More than clean, considering Steam says I have 2,360 hours in the game. But rather than go back to 3 or New Vegas, I pulled the trigger on a purchase I made back when it was on single-digit sale. Yep, 76. The crazy thing is... I\'m enjoying it? It\'s definitely not the garbage show I remember seeing videos about. The loop is very similar to 4, but with little changes that make things interesting to me. It helps that I\'m keeping ahead of myself to play for my own sake. None of that FOMO stuff, if a daily challenge thing is interesting or something I was already going to do, sure. Otherwise, play for exploring/the story(?) and stop when I\'m bored or feel like it\'s a slog. And so far, it\'s been really good. I like how they shuffled certain materials around so that your goals change. Other than maybe adhesive, you\'re never really just going \\"need this thing\\" forever.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Dub Sympathizer"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hukv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Dub Sympathizer","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654606,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654619,"updated_utc":1682654620,"body_sha1":"754307ef385ab8cb28e89aeed9c80d92de11c390","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:03:26"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0htpt","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zealousideal-Reach36","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447955745,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_84sntr8y","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yea, the bucks literally failed to meet the expectations of a number 1 seed.

At work, we\xe2\x80\x99re opening up our greenhouse for sales today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see our work pay off (literally). Let\xe2\x80\x99s get into it!\\n\\nMy love of **Picross** has finally been reignited. The Switch games are on sale for like 8 bucks a piece right now so I picked a bunch of them up and, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s still Picross so it\xe2\x80\x99s still the GOAT puzzle game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a few before bed every night just to tucker my brain out and man, it\xe2\x80\x99s just such great stuff. Go buy a couple of the Picross S games on Switch while they\xe2\x80\x99re on sale because they\xe2\x80\x99re just so fucking fun.\\n\\nThe **Advance Wars** remakes are *amazing.* They feel now like how they felt in my child brain when I was a child. I\xe2\x80\x99m still not a *massive* fan of the artstyle changes because I still adore the original pixel art (and there\xe2\x80\x99s something weirdly uncanny about watching these pseudo-3D models sway back and forth) but it\xe2\x80\x99s still *really* great! It\xe2\x80\x99s still one of my favorite tactical RPGs of that era and I am going to continue praying every single day that, with the relative success of the Ogre Tactics remaster, Triangle Strategy, and the Advance Wars remake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get FFT in some form. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a full remaster, just let me play FFT/FFTA/A2 again on modern consoles and I\xe2\x80\x99m in, guys.\\n\\nEvery new week of **Destiny** feels more and more like the game is disintegrating in front of my very eyes. What a mess. Still playing it because, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m 9 years deep and at a minimum, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see through what happens with the Final Shape, but after that\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bungie has at least one, maybe two new IPs in the cooker: Matter, which we know very little about beyond a couple of pieces of concept art and some job listings regarding a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter-based pvp game.\xe2\x80\x9d Rumors also abound that Bungie is working on some form of extraction shooter (for those unfamiliar with the term, think Tarkov). We also know Bungie was looking for devs to work on both an FPS and a Third-Person game\xe2\x80\xa6 so if I had to put money on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Matter is the third-person title and whatever this potential extraction shooter is would be your FPS title. But ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting either of those titles going forward, if only because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I particularly trust Bungie to put out well-balanced pvp-focused stuff anymore. While obviously Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is pretty unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Bungie was really ever known for their well-crafted competitive multiplayer experiences, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m also just not a big pvp-only gamer so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for me. We already know they plan to keep Destiny going past Final Shape without a Destiny 3 of sorts but like\xe2\x80\xa6 at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a major change. Dropping last-gen is going to have to occur at some point considering the tech debt that already exists within the game\xe2\x80\x99s myriad systems and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really do love this franchise with all my heart but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot at the moment. And I worry about the future of the franchise because, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s *still* nothing like it in the modern market. The Division 2 is great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not Destiny.\\n\\nOh, and **Honkai Star Rail** is out and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I expected it to be. I played absolutely *zero* of Genshin Impact, but I *did* play Honkai 3rd Impact and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly a direct sequel or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see some returning folks, like Seele and Bunny Bronya from H3i. Gameplay is relatively tight, definitely a little bit light on tactical strength but I\xe2\x80\x99m really early in. English VO work is preeeeetty solid although it suffers in the same way a lot of English VO work does in these sorts of things. The F!Trailblazer\xe2\x80\x99s design is *stellar* and her VO work is honestly very good as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mihoyo gacha, so I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating hating my life for drop rates (and at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s already sad, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled two actual characters in like thirty pulls with the pre-reg gifts), but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to putting some more time into it. Plays like shit on mobile though--runs fine, I just hate third-person movement control in my phone. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sticking to FGO and Octopath on mobile and playing HSR on PC.\\n\\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna start talking about wrasslin\xe2\x80\x99 on these post so apologies if you\xe2\x80\x99re not into that. **Dynamite** this week was just that. Orange Cassidy v. Bandido was an incredible opener, the two of them have great chemistry. The continuing questions about BCC v. The Elite and Takeshita is interesting, the Darby/Sammy match was great and getting a tag team next week will be interesting. Roddy Strong\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a *huge* surprise for me, I could not fucking believe it when I heard End of Heartache. Getting Cole/Strong/OC/Bandido v. JAS next week is a *weird* combo but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it if it means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting Cole back in the ring with Roddy Strong. Now we just need Bobby Fish to stop being a living meme and things will be great again. Meanwhile, **RAW** was mostly good, the segments with Sami and the Usos backstage were nice, although I\xe2\x80\x99d like that storyline to pick up. Cody/Balor was a weird match. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a whole hell of a lot about what happened on RAW. Draft is *tonight* though! We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting Jay White/Juice Robinson vs. Ricky Starks/Shawn Spears on Rampage tonight, which\xe2\x80\xa6 really stoked that we\xe2\x80\x99re already demoting White to Rampage, but whatever. He\xe2\x80\x99s still my boy. BREATHE.\\n\\nOther than that, pretty uneventful week for me. Dog had a bit of a health scare but he seems to be doing better in some capacity so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying about him all week. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting old, and we all know what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into when we get pets, but it still hurts when you think about them leaving. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to distract myself from it.

Also big news, we found out we\xe2\x80\x99re having a girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers. If Reaves/Hachimura continue to play solid and D\xe2\x80\x99Lo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shit the bed LeBron/AD is enough to power them through the field.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anxious Millennial Teacher"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlce/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Anxious Millennial Teacher","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654473,"updated_utc":1682654474,"body_sha1":"a3d7c43cf11e8115b9312d12386ed79c30cab5f7","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:00:58"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0gj","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"exmormon","author_flair_template_id":"fca9e4d2-3b8e-11e5-9781-0e37a0ef8875","id":"ji0hkq2","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zadok47","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_p1jzwkj7","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your child should NOT have a record card started when born.

This limits grain farmers who want to deal with CGC assurances to dealing with the big 6, CARGILL, VITERRA/g3, RICHARDSONS, PATERSONS, P&amp;H and ADM. not all six will be economically close to every farmer so you might have the option of 3 to work with\\n\\nNow the Canadian grain commission (CGC) regulates grain varieties in Canada so you have to grow a registered variety or your grain is basically considered feed grade(not always bad pricing) and these 6 companies own the rights to their own varieties\xe2\x80\xa6 they can\xe2\x80\x99t not buy grain from a farmer if it\xe2\x80\x99s a registered variety and meets grading requirements but they can make it difficult aaaaaaand they also own their own fertilizer/input companies so if you want to get a deal on inputs, you better be growing their product that they want you to grow.  When it comes to grain the only real bargain chip farmers have is storage till prices go up. But your bills are accumulating interest so you\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes just have to take whatever deals out there.\\n\\nNow on vegetables, your basically not going to grow them unless you have a guaranteed\\nContract from somewhere because storage isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually an option and your overhead is fucking unreal so there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe 3 distribution companies and 2 processors to deal with or your dealing directly with the grocery chain.

and cripple your onion business\xe2\x80\x9d they can only do that for a certain percent of the total to keep everybody happy the only way margin can be extracted is higher prices from the consumer who does in fact have to eat or lower prices to the farmer who needs cash flow to stay solvent.\\n\\nBasically an eat shit or get fucked situation unless you have a grower/buyer co-op with other farmers but that\xe2\x80\x99s communism /s\\n\\nAlso just remember when (generic crisis/shortage/whatever lie) the grocery chains are telling you is the reason prices are going up, those hardships and costs are dealt at the farm level and have no effect on the chain\xe2\x80\x99s operation except as a handy excuse to raise prices\\n\\n\\nThis is why I direct market to consumer or partner with independent

There\'s a semi-famous story about Morey going through the data for one of those Harden Rockets seasons and finding that \'random\', the name they gave for \'set a random screen or something idk\' was their most effective \'play\' by a mile.\\n\\nYou want players to have freedom to improvise, they\'re in the game they\'re reading the defenses, they have to make decisions in fractions of seconds.\\n\\nI think you can imagine it like the coach is providing both instructions and a cookbook for a team and telling them to cook for a party of ten. If that team is a great chef, then giving them some freedom is good - they can navigate the meal better by feel and reacting to what\'s happening - they know the shortcuts they can make and what needs done when. If the team is not such a good chef then maybe they need some stricter measurements, stricter timings. If you give them a list of recipes one team could get bogged down trying to decide, another might just really like an omelette and think that the party of ten will love just an omelette and another omelette and another omelette. One might not even need the book, they thrive with what they think would be good with what they have in front of them.\\n\\nThat\'s a very odd metaphor in hindsight, but it\'s just about mediation. If you are calling out a set every single possession then it\'s going to get old, the defense are going to catch on, and you\'re going to get messed up if something early in the process breaks down. That\'s why, I think, Budenholzer has his system. I think the problem is that for this Bucks roster freelancing is leading to a lot of poor shot selection, the off-ball reps don\'t happen because there\'s less often a purpose for it, and tired legs in the fourth (which get tired quickly because of an old roster) lead to bias toward the easiest option; the thought of watching someone iso is quietly more appealing when you\'re knackered.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Bucks2","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":mke-2:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/yng44hxzs4r81_t5_2qo4s/mke-2"},{"e":"text","t":" Bucks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1318nhi","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1318nhi/charania_mike_budenholzers_status_as_bucks_head/ji0h0jy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":mke-2: Bucks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654133,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"904f272bca517e92aef463f3b1ae36dd54a314f5","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_8aqc5g","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"OvertimeMeganNudes","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0hk","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Honest_Invite_3869","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9okj3vkt","all_awardings":[],"body":"https://discord.gg/TkZzusvV\\n\\nif these people had it for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d they would send the link in here, i got it for 3 bucks join the discord it says what to do","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1307xd9","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/OvertimeMeganNudes/comments/1307xd9/rovertimemegannudes_lounge/ji0h0hk/","subreddit_type":"restricted","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654132,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OvertimeMeganNudes","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"02bb3541bc8994d7cc8834c4b22a656109e5a69e","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:32"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_5m1dzu","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"rabbitsincolonies","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0fz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Nightshade_Ranch","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_bwifz8nm","all_awardings":[],"body":"Takes at least six weeks post neuter for the hormones to settle.

It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great.

He alone is worth double the panda energy company. That\'s the kind of money we are talking. Legitimate fuck you money.\\n\\nI recall the whole AEW thing being that TK is using his inheritance money (which is his not his dad\'s) to run the company. His dad wanted to see his kids  venture into their passions since he knew they were gonna spend the money anyways (Sure wish I had a dad like that lmao, if I had asked mine for twenty bucks he\'d be like \\"why you need ten dollars?\\").\\n\\nAnyways AEW probably isn\'t profitable rn I do agree with that, but I don\'t think it\'s haemorrhaging money nor is it in any financial troubles in the near future, that\'s what I am trying to say. Financially they\'ll be fine, we shouldn\'t care about their finances because we ain\'t financial experts, well unless you are in which case what should I invest in.

And now it is no longer Turd, not even Turd Ferguson, but [Mona.](https://imgur.com/a/luuzY42) Kind of a twist on a character of mine named Monika, which fits considering our last cat was Max. I\'ve never had a cat who loves being under the covers.\\n\\nWho are these characters you\'re talking about, you ask? Probably not but I\'ll do my spiel anyways! Please read [The Demon in Shadow!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-utFIYKm01e-xYdXfUMatPCuHeOfIICka2NZOJDpls/edit?usp=sharing) It\'s a full novel by myself about a human and demon who get caught up in each other\'s problems and become closer for it. It\'s set in an original world and made in such a way that you\'re learning about how things work alongside demon deuteragonist Ayun. And it\'s got amazing artwork in the back that I\'ve comissioned that gain more context when you read the thang ding.\\n\\nAfter last week\'s departure it\'s time to get back into the backlog. A kit that\'s been sitting in my stash for a while is [the Rune God Rayearth from the titular series Magic Knight Rayearth!](https://imgur.com/a/8NfVGAL) It\'s a pretty recent release from Goodsmile, syncing up nicely with them showing up in SRW 30... Even if they technically debuted in T. It doesn\'t have dual language, but it comes with a fully colored manual that is very good at pointing out how things need to be set in and work. It also has a good amount of pre-painted parts like the face and sword. Its articulation is a little stiff, which isn\'t helped by things like the skirt but I still think it looks great. Has enough hands to make fun poses and the flame effects on the wings are dope. Selece and Windam are waiting in the wings, so it will be great to have them all in one shot. \\n\\nSide note, the series is on Amazon Prime, dubbed and subbed? The dub isn\'t too bad, but the video quality is pretty bad. I guess it fits that 90s vibe? But I can\'t help but think there are much better transfers on the high seas. I mean, that Nadia one I found is GORGEOUS and that show came out five years prior to Rayearth. \\n\\nI was going to save this one for a rainy day, but neither this or the Rayearth shoots had a lot of content. And I was surprised that it wasn\'t a kit at all! I\'m talking about Joytoy\'s 40K figures! I got an [Imperial Fists Primaris Marine,](https://imgur.com/a/JWTVtzd) one of those early angry boys. I thought about going Space Wolves like the actual units I used to have somewhere, but this was part of a sale on USAG and the dogs were already sold out. For an action figure, this thing has a lot of good points going for it. Great articulation (except for one part we\'ll get to), good detailing, and even not on sale 40 bucks isn\'t bad at all. What does kill me about this thing are the hands. Not a lack of them, but the joints themselves. For some unknown reason, the wrists connect at two points. But the one that connects to the hand is super tight. To the point I had to bust out pliers in fear of dislodging a nail. And then fearing that trying to separate these pieces would just snap the joint altogether. Not fun. That\'s why there\'s a lot less shots, even though it comes with some cool hands. The other thing is that because of those beefy pauldrons, action poses aren\'t easy. Dynamic ones are perfect. Hold the gun up, rest the chainsword on your shoulder no problem. But aiming the gun might as well look like a Gundam kit from the 80s. You can remove the shoulders, but it doesn\'t really fix that problem. I think if they get rid of the stupid hand garbage it would be an easy recommendation from me. But as it stands, maybe get one you like and never change their weapons.\\n\\nI fell back into Fallout 4 for a minute, but I feel like even with some good mods I had scraped that rock clean. More than clean, considering Steam says I have 2,360 hours in the game. But rather than go back to 3 or New Vegas, I pulled the trigger on a purchase I made back when it was on single-digit sale. Yep, 76. The crazy thing is... I\'m enjoying it? It\'s definitely not the garbage show I remember seeing videos about. The loop is very similar to 4, but with little changes that make things interesting to me. It helps that I\'m keeping ahead of myself to play for my own sake. None of that FOMO stuff, if a daily challenge thing is interesting or something I was already going to do, sure. Otherwise, play for exploring/the story(?) and stop when I\'m bored or feel like it\'s a slog. And so far, it\'s been really good. I like how they shuffled certain materials around so that your goals change. Other than maybe adhesive, you\'re never really just going \\"need this thing\\" forever.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Dub Sympathizer"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hukv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Dub Sympathizer","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654606,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654619,"updated_utc":1682654620,"body_sha1":"754307ef385ab8cb28e89aeed9c80d92de11c390","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:03:26"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0htpt","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zealousideal-Reach36","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447955745,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_84sntr8y","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yea, the bucks literally failed to meet the expectations of a number 1 seed.

Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a full remaster, just let me play FFT/FFTA/A2 again on modern consoles and I\xe2\x80\x99m in, guys.\\n\\nEvery new week of **Destiny** feels more and more like the game is disintegrating in front of my very eyes. What a mess. Still playing it because, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m 9 years deep and at a minimum, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see through what happens with the Final Shape, but after that\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bungie has at least one, maybe two new IPs in the cooker: Matter, which we know very little about beyond a couple of pieces of concept art and some job listings regarding a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter-based pvp game.\xe2\x80\x9d Rumors also abound that Bungie is working on some form of extraction shooter (for those unfamiliar with the term, think Tarkov). We also know Bungie was looking for devs to work on both an FPS and a Third-Person game\xe2\x80\xa6 so if I had to put money on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Matter is the third-person title and whatever this potential extraction shooter is would be your FPS title. But ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting either of those titles going forward, if only because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I particularly trust Bungie to put out well-balanced pvp-focused stuff anymore. While obviously Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is pretty unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Bungie was really ever known for their well-crafted competitive multiplayer experiences, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m also just not a big pvp-only gamer so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for me. We already know they plan to keep Destiny going past Final Shape without a Destiny 3 of sorts but like\xe2\x80\xa6 at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a major change. Dropping last-gen is going to have to occur at some point considering the tech debt that already exists within the game\xe2\x80\x99s myriad systems and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really do love this franchise with all my heart but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot at the moment. And I worry about the future of the franchise because, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s *still* nothing like it in the modern market. The Division 2 is great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not Destiny.\\n\\nOh, and **Honkai Star Rail** is out and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I expected it to be. I played absolutely *zero* of Genshin Impact, but I *did* play Honkai 3rd Impact and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly a direct sequel or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see some returning folks, like Seele and Bunny Bronya from H3i. Gameplay is relatively tight, definitely a little bit light on tactical strength but I\xe2\x80\x99m really early in. English VO work is preeeeetty solid although it suffers in the same way a lot of English VO work does in these sorts of things. The F!Trailblazer\xe2\x80\x99s design is *stellar* and her VO work is honestly very good as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mihoyo gacha, so I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating hating my life for drop rates (and at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s already sad, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled two actual characters in like thirty pulls with the pre-reg gifts), but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to putting some more time into it. Plays like shit on mobile though--runs fine, I just hate third-person movement control in my phone. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sticking to FGO and Octopath on mobile and playing HSR on PC.\\n\\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna start talking about wrasslin\xe2\x80\x99 on these post so apologies if you\xe2\x80\x99re not into that. **Dynamite** this week was just that. Orange Cassidy v. Bandido was an incredible opener, the two of them have great chemistry. The continuing questions about BCC v. The Elite and Takeshita is interesting, the Darby/Sammy match was great and getting a tag team next week will be interesting. Roddy Strong\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a *huge* surprise for me, I could not fucking believe it when I heard End of Heartache. Getting Cole/Strong/OC/Bandido v. JAS next week is a *weird* combo but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it if it means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting Cole back in the ring with Roddy Strong. Now we just need Bobby Fish to stop being a living meme and things will be great again. Meanwhile, **RAW** was mostly good, the segments with Sami and the Usos backstage were nice, although I\xe2\x80\x99d like that storyline to pick up. Cody/Balor was a weird match. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a whole hell of a lot about what happened on RAW. Draft is *tonight* though! We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting Jay White/Juice Robinson vs. Ricky Starks/Shawn Spears on Rampage tonight, which\xe2\x80\xa6 really stoked that we\xe2\x80\x99re already demoting White to Rampage, but whatever. He\xe2\x80\x99s still my boy. BREATHE.\\n\\nOther than that, pretty uneventful week for me. Dog had a bit of a health scare but he seems to be doing better in some capacity so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying about him all week. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting old, and we all know what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into when we get pets, but it still hurts when you think about them leaving. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to distract myself from it. Hope everyone\xe2\x80\x99s week was good!\\n\\n-----\\n\\n2023 Games Completed Count: 16\\n\\n[My HLTB Archive](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/waycarer/games)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"wat","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Resident Atelier Stan"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlsc/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Resident Atelier Stan","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"4fba5371d48b2a62bc3329c4e03a41761b0fee89","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers. If Reaves/Hachimura continue to play solid and D\xe2\x80\x99Lo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shit the bed LeBron/AD is enough to power them through the field.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anxious Millennial Teacher"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlce/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Anxious Millennial Teacher","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654473,"updated_utc":1682654474,"body_sha1":"a3d7c43cf11e8115b9312d12386ed79c30cab5f7","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:00:58"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0gj","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"exmormon","author_flair_template_id":"fca9e4d2-3b8e-11e5-9781-0e37a0ef8875","id":"ji0hkq2","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zadok47","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_p1jzwkj7","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your child should NOT have a record card started when born.

When it comes to grain the only real bargain chip farmers have is storage till prices go up. But your bills are accumulating interest so you\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes just have to take whatever deals out there.\\n\\nNow on vegetables, your basically not going to grow them unless you have a guaranteed\\nContract from somewhere because storage isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually an option and your overhead is fucking unreal so there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe 3 distribution companies and 2 processors to deal with or your dealing directly with the grocery chain.

There\'s a semi-famous story about Morey going through the data for one of those Harden Rockets seasons and finding that \'random\', the name they gave for \'set a random screen or something idk\' was their most effective \'play\' by a mile.\\n\\nYou want players to have freedom to improvise, they\'re in the game they\'re reading the defenses, they have to make decisions in fractions of seconds.\\n\\nI think you can imagine it like the coach is providing both instructions and a cookbook for a team and telling them to cook for a party of ten. If that team is a great chef, then giving them some freedom is good - they can navigate the meal better by feel and reacting to what\'s happening - they know the shortcuts they can make and what needs done when. If the team is not such a good chef then maybe they need some stricter measurements, stricter timings. If you give them a list of recipes one team could get bogged down trying to decide, another might just really like an omelette and think that the party of ten will love just an omelette and another omelette and another omelette. One might not even need the book, they thrive with what they think would be good with what they have in front of them.\\n\\nThat\'s a very odd metaphor in hindsight, but it\'s just about mediation. If you are calling out a set every single possession then it\'s going to get old, the defense are going to catch on, and you\'re going to get messed up if something early in the process breaks down. That\'s why, I think, Budenholzer has his system. I think the problem is that for this Bucks roster freelancing is leading to a lot of poor shot selection, the off-ball reps don\'t happen because there\'s less often a purpose for it, and tired legs in the fourth (which get tired quickly because of an old roster) lead to bias toward the easiest option; the thought of watching someone iso is quietly more appealing when you\'re knackered.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Bucks2","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":mke-2:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/yng44hxzs4r81_t5_2qo4s/mke-2"},{"e":"text","t":" Bucks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1318nhi","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1318nhi/charania_mike_budenholzers_status_as_bucks_head/ji0h0jy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":mke-2: Bucks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654133,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"904f272bca517e92aef463f3b1ae36dd54a314f5","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_8aqc5g","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"OvertimeMeganNudes","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0hk","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Honest_Invite_3869","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9okj3vkt","all_awardings":[],"body":"https://discord.gg/TkZzusvV\\n\\nif these people had it for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d they would send the link in here, i got it for 3 bucks join the discord it says what to do","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1307xd9","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/OvertimeMeganNudes/comments/1307xd9/rovertimemegannudes_lounge/ji0h0hk/","subreddit_type":"restricted","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654132,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OvertimeMeganNudes","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"02bb3541bc8994d7cc8834c4b22a656109e5a69e","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:32"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_5m1dzu","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"rabbitsincolonies","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0fz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Nightshade_Ranch","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_bwifz8nm","all_awardings":[],"body":"Takes at least six weeks post neuter for the hormones to settle.

Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great.

And now it is no longer Turd, not even Turd Ferguson, but [Mona.](https://imgur.com/a/luuzY42) Kind of a twist on a character of mine named Monika, which fits considering our last cat was Max. I\'ve never had a cat who loves being under the covers.\\n\\nWho are these characters you\'re talking about, you ask? Probably not but I\'ll do my spiel anyways! Please read [The Demon in Shadow!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-utFIYKm01e-xYdXfUMatPCuHeOfIICka2NZOJDpls/edit?usp=sharing) It\'s a full novel by myself about a human and demon who get caught up in each other\'s problems and become closer for it. It\'s set in an original world and made in such a way that you\'re learning about how things work alongside demon deuteragonist Ayun. And it\'s got amazing artwork in the back that I\'ve comissioned that gain more context when you read the thang ding.\\n\\nAfter last week\'s departure it\'s time to get back into the backlog. A kit that\'s been sitting in my stash for a while is [the Rune God Rayearth from the titular series Magic Knight Rayearth!](https://imgur.com/a/8NfVGAL) It\'s a pretty recent release from Goodsmile, syncing up nicely with them showing up in SRW 30... Even if they technically debuted in T. It doesn\'t have dual language, but it comes with a fully colored manual that is very good at pointing out how things need to be set in and work. It also has a good amount of pre-painted parts like the face and sword. Its articulation is a little stiff, which isn\'t helped by things like the skirt but I still think it looks great. Has enough hands to make fun poses and the flame effects on the wings are dope. Selece and Windam are waiting in the wings, so it will be great to have them all in one shot. \\n\\nSide note, the series is on Amazon Prime, dubbed and subbed? The dub isn\'t too bad, but the video quality is pretty bad. I guess it fits that 90s vibe? But I can\'t help but think there are much better transfers on the high seas. I mean, that Nadia one I found is GORGEOUS and that show came out five years prior to Rayearth. \\n\\nI was going to save this one for a rainy day, but neither this or the Rayearth shoots had a lot of content. And I was surprised that it wasn\'t a kit at all! I\'m talking about Joytoy\'s 40K figures! I got an [Imperial Fists Primaris Marine,](https://imgur.com/a/JWTVtzd) one of those early angry boys. I thought about going Space Wolves like the actual units I used to have somewhere, but this was part of a sale on USAG and the dogs were already sold out. For an action figure, this thing has a lot of good points going for it. Great articulation (except for one part we\'ll get to), good detailing, and even not on sale 40 bucks isn\'t bad at all. What does kill me about this thing are the hands. Not a lack of them, but the joints themselves. For some unknown reason, the wrists connect at two points. But the one that connects to the hand is super tight. To the point I had to bust out pliers in fear of dislodging a nail. And then fearing that trying to separate these pieces would just snap the joint altogether. Not fun. That\'s why there\'s a lot less shots, even though it comes with some cool hands. The other thing is that because of those beefy pauldrons, action poses aren\'t easy. Dynamic ones are perfect. Hold the gun up, rest the chainsword on your shoulder no problem. But aiming the gun might as well look like a Gundam kit from the 80s. You can remove the shoulders, but it doesn\'t really fix that problem. I think if they get rid of the stupid hand garbage it would be an easy recommendation from me. But as it stands, maybe get one you like and never change their weapons.\\n\\nI fell back into Fallout 4 for a minute, but I feel like even with some good mods I had scraped that rock clean. More than clean, considering Steam says I have 2,360 hours in the game. But rather than go back to 3 or New Vegas, I pulled the trigger on a purchase I made back when it was on single-digit sale. Yep, 76. The crazy thing is... I\'m enjoying it? It\'s definitely not the garbage show I remember seeing videos about. The loop is very similar to 4, but with little changes that make things interesting to me. It helps that I\'m keeping ahead of myself to play for my own sake. None of that FOMO stuff, if a daily challenge thing is interesting or something I was already going to do, sure. Otherwise, play for exploring/the story(?) and stop when I\'m bored or feel like it\'s a slog. And so far, it\'s been really good. I like how they shuffled certain materials around so that your goals change.

At work, we\xe2\x80\x99re opening up our greenhouse for sales today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see our work pay off (literally). Let\xe2\x80\x99s get into it!\\n\\nMy love of **Picross** has finally been reignited. The Switch games are on sale for like 8 bucks a piece right now so I picked a bunch of them up and, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s still Picross so it\xe2\x80\x99s still the GOAT puzzle game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a few before bed every night just to tucker my brain out and man, it\xe2\x80\x99s just such great stuff. Go buy a couple of the Picross S games on Switch while they\xe2\x80\x99re on sale because they\xe2\x80\x99re just so fucking fun.\\n\\nThe **Advance Wars** remakes are *amazing.* They feel now like how they felt in my child brain when I was a child. I\xe2\x80\x99m still not a *massive* fan of the artstyle changes because I still adore the original pixel art (and there\xe2\x80\x99s something weirdly uncanny about watching these pseudo-3D models sway back and forth) but it\xe2\x80\x99s still *really* great! It\xe2\x80\x99s still one of my favorite tactical RPGs of that era and I am going to continue praying every single day that, with the relative success of the Ogre Tactics remaster, Triangle Strategy, and the Advance Wars remake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get FFT in some form. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a full remaster, just let me play FFT/FFTA/A2 again on modern consoles and I\xe2\x80\x99m in, guys.\\n\\nEvery new week of **Destiny** feels more and more like the game is disintegrating in front of my very eyes. What a mess. Still playing it because, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m 9 years deep and at a minimum, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see through what happens with the Final Shape, but after that\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bungie has at least one, maybe two new IPs in the cooker: Matter, which we know very little about beyond a couple of pieces of concept art and some job listings regarding a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter-based pvp game.\xe2\x80\x9d Rumors also abound that Bungie is working on some form of extraction shooter (for those unfamiliar with the term, think Tarkov). We also know Bungie was looking for devs to work on both an FPS and a Third-Person game\xe2\x80\xa6 so if I had to put money on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Matter is the third-person title and whatever this potential extraction shooter is would be your FPS title. But ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting either of those titles going forward, if only because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I particularly trust Bungie to put out well-balanced pvp-focused stuff anymore. While obviously Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is pretty unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Bungie was really ever known for their well-crafted competitive multiplayer experiences, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m also just not a big pvp-only gamer so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for me. We already know they plan to keep Destiny going past Final Shape without a Destiny 3 of sorts but like\xe2\x80\xa6 at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a major change. Dropping last-gen is going to have to occur at some point considering the tech debt that already exists within the game\xe2\x80\x99s myriad systems and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really do love this franchise with all my heart but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot at the moment. And I worry about the future of the franchise because, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s *still* nothing like it in the modern market. The Division 2 is great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not Destiny.\\n\\nOh, and **Honkai Star Rail** is out and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I expected it to be. I played absolutely *zero* of Genshin Impact, but I *did* play Honkai 3rd Impact and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly a direct sequel or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see some returning folks, like Seele and Bunny Bronya from H3i. Gameplay is relatively tight, definitely a little bit light on tactical strength but I\xe2\x80\x99m really early in. English VO work is preeeeetty solid although it suffers in the same way a lot of English VO work does in these sorts of things. The F!Trailblazer\xe2\x80\x99s design is *stellar* and her VO work is honestly very good as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mihoyo gacha, so I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating hating my life for drop rates (and at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s already sad, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled two actual characters in like thirty pulls with the pre-reg gifts), but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to putting some more time into it. Plays like shit on mobile though--runs fine, I just hate third-person movement control in my phone. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sticking to FGO and Octopath on mobile and playing HSR on PC.\\n\\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna start talking about wrasslin\xe2\x80\x99 on these post so apologies if you\xe2\x80\x99re not into that. **Dynamite** this week was just that. Orange Cassidy v. Bandido was an incredible opener, the two of them have great chemistry. The continuing questions about BCC v. The Elite and Takeshita is interesting, the Darby/Sammy match was great and getting a tag team next week will be interesting. Roddy Strong\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a *huge* surprise for me, I could not fucking believe it when I heard End of Heartache. Getting Cole/Strong/OC/Bandido v. JAS next week is a *weird* combo but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it if it means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting Cole back in the ring with Roddy Strong. Now we just need Bobby Fish to stop being a living meme and things will be great again. Meanwhile, **RAW** was mostly good, the segments with Sami and the Usos backstage were nice, although I\xe2\x80\x99d like that storyline to pick up. Cody/Balor was a weird match. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a whole hell of a lot about what happened on RAW. Draft is *tonight* though! We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting Jay White/Juice Robinson vs. Ricky Starks/Shawn Spears on Rampage tonight, which\xe2\x80\xa6 really stoked that we\xe2\x80\x99re already demoting White to Rampage, but whatever. He\xe2\x80\x99s still my boy. BREATHE.\\n\\nOther than that, pretty uneventful week for me. Dog had a bit of a health scare but he seems to be doing better in some capacity so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying about him all week. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting old, and we all know what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into when we get pets, but it still hurts when you think about them leaving. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to distract myself from it. Hope everyone\xe2\x80\x99s week was good!\\n\\n-----\\n\\n2023 Games Completed Count: 16\\n\\n[My HLTB Archive](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/waycarer/games)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"wat","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Resident Atelier Stan"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlsc/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Resident Atelier Stan","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"4fba5371d48b2a62bc3329c4e03a41761b0fee89","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers. If Reaves/Hachimura continue to play solid and D\xe2\x80\x99Lo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shit the bed LeBron/AD is enough to power them through the field.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anxious Millennial Teacher"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlce/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Anxious Millennial Teacher","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654473,"updated_utc":1682654474,"body_sha1":"a3d7c43cf11e8115b9312d12386ed79c30cab5f7","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:00:58"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0gj","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"exmormon","author_flair_template_id":"fca9e4d2-3b8e-11e5-9781-0e37a0ef8875","id":"ji0hkq2","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zadok47","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_p1jzwkj7","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your child should NOT have a record card started when born.

There\'s a semi-famous story about Morey going through the data for one of those Harden Rockets seasons and finding that \'random\', the name they gave for \'set a random screen or something idk\' was their most effective \'play\' by a mile.\\n\\nYou want players to have freedom to improvise, they\'re in the game they\'re reading the defenses, they have to make decisions in fractions of seconds.\\n\\nI think you can imagine it like the coach is providing both instructions and a cookbook for a team and telling them to cook for a party of ten. If that team is a great chef, then giving them some freedom is good - they can navigate the meal better by feel and reacting to what\'s happening - they know the shortcuts they can make and what needs done when. If the team is not such a good chef then maybe they need some stricter measurements, stricter timings. If you give them a list of recipes one team could get bogged down trying to decide, another might just really like an omelette and think that the party of ten will love just an omelette and another omelette and another omelette. One might not even need the book, they thrive with what they think would be good with what they have in front of them.\\n\\nThat\'s a very odd metaphor in hindsight, but it\'s just about mediation. If you are calling out a set every single possession then it\'s going to get old, the defense are going to catch on, and you\'re going to get messed up if something early in the process breaks down. That\'s why, I think, Budenholzer has his system. I think the problem is that for this Bucks roster freelancing is leading to a lot of poor shot selection, the off-ball reps don\'t happen because there\'s less often a purpose for it, and tired legs in the fourth (which get tired quickly because of an old roster) lead to bias toward the easiest option; the thought of watching someone iso is quietly more appealing when you\'re knackered.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Bucks2","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":mke-2:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/yng44hxzs4r81_t5_2qo4s/mke-2"},{"e":"text","t":" Bucks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1318nhi","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1318nhi/charania_mike_budenholzers_status_as_bucks_head/ji0h0jy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":mke-2: Bucks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654133,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"904f272bca517e92aef463f3b1ae36dd54a314f5","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_8aqc5g","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"OvertimeMeganNudes","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0hk","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Honest_Invite_3869","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9okj3vkt","all_awardings":[],"body":"https://discord.gg/TkZzusvV\\n\\nif these people had it for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d they would send the link in here, i got it for 3 bucks join the discord it says what to do","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1307xd9","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/OvertimeMeganNudes/comments/1307xd9/rovertimemegannudes_lounge/ji0h0hk/","subreddit_type":"restricted","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654132,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OvertimeMeganNudes","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"02bb3541bc8994d7cc8834c4b22a656109e5a69e","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:32"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_5m1dzu","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"rabbitsincolonies","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0fz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Nightshade_Ranch","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_bwifz8nm","all_awardings":[],"body":"Takes at least six weeks post neuter for the hormones to settle.

I\'ve never had a cat who loves being under the covers.\\n\\nWho are these characters you\'re talking about, you ask? Probably not but I\'ll do my spiel anyways! Please read [The Demon in Shadow!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-utFIYKm01e-xYdXfUMatPCuHeOfIICka2NZOJDpls/edit?usp=sharing) It\'s a full novel by myself about a human and demon who get caught up in each other\'s problems and become closer for it. It\'s set in an original world and made in such a way that you\'re learning about how things work alongside demon deuteragonist Ayun. And it\'s got amazing artwork in the back that I\'ve comissioned that gain more context when you read the thang ding.\\n\\nAfter last week\'s departure it\'s time to get back into the backlog. A kit that\'s been sitting in my stash for a while is [the Rune God Rayearth from the titular series Magic Knight Rayearth!](https://imgur.com/a/8NfVGAL) It\'s a pretty recent release from Goodsmile, syncing up nicely with them showing up in SRW 30... Even if they technically debuted in T. It doesn\'t have dual language, but it comes with a fully colored manual that is very good at pointing out how things need to be set in and work. It also has a good amount of pre-painted parts like the face and sword. Its articulation is a little stiff, which isn\'t helped by things like the skirt but I still think it looks great. Has enough hands to make fun poses and the flame effects on the wings are dope. Selece and Windam are waiting in the wings, so it will be great to have them all in one shot. \\n\\nSide note, the series is on Amazon Prime, dubbed and subbed? The dub isn\'t too bad, but the video quality is pretty bad. I guess it fits that 90s vibe? But I can\'t help but think there are much better transfers on the high seas. I mean, that Nadia one I found is GORGEOUS and that show came out five years prior to Rayearth. \\n\\nI was going to save this one for a rainy day, but neither this or the Rayearth shoots had a lot of content.

I thought about going Space Wolves like the actual units I used to have somewhere, but this was part of a sale on USAG and the dogs were already sold out. For an action figure, this thing has a lot of good points going for it. Great articulation (except for one part we\'ll get to), good detailing, and even not on sale 40 bucks isn\'t bad at all. What does kill me about this thing are the hands. Not a lack of them, but the joints themselves. For some unknown reason, the wrists connect at two points. But the one that connects to the hand is super tight. To the point I had to bust out pliers in fear of dislodging a nail. And then fearing that trying to separate these pieces would just snap the joint altogether. Not fun. That\'s why there\'s a lot less shots, even though it comes with some cool hands. The other thing is that because of those beefy pauldrons, action poses aren\'t easy. Dynamic ones are perfect. Hold the gun up, rest the chainsword on your shoulder no problem. But aiming the gun might as well look like a Gundam kit from the 80s. You can remove the shoulders, but it doesn\'t really fix that problem. I think if they get rid of the stupid hand garbage it would be an easy recommendation from me. But as it stands, maybe get one you like and never change their weapons.\\n\\nI fell back into Fallout 4 for a minute, but I feel like even with some good mods I had scraped that rock clean. More than clean, considering Steam says I have 2,360 hours in the game. But rather than go back to 3 or New Vegas, I pulled the trigger on a purchase I made back when it was on single-digit sale. Yep, 76. The crazy thing is... I\'m enjoying it? It\'s definitely not the garbage show I remember seeing videos about. The loop is very similar to 4, but with little changes that make things interesting to me. It helps that I\'m keeping ahead of myself to play for my own sake. None of that FOMO stuff, if a daily challenge thing is interesting or something I was already going to do, sure. Otherwise, play for exploring/the story(?) and stop when I\'m bored or feel like it\'s a slog. And so far, it\'s been really good. I like how they shuffled certain materials around so that your goals change. Other than maybe adhesive, you\'re never really just going \\"need this thing\\" forever.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Dub Sympathizer"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hukv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Dub Sympathizer","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654606,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654619,"updated_utc":1682654620,"body_sha1":"754307ef385ab8cb28e89aeed9c80d92de11c390","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:03:26"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0htpt","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zealousideal-Reach36","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447955745,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_84sntr8y","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yea, the bucks literally failed to meet the expectations of a number 1 seed.

At work, we\xe2\x80\x99re opening up our greenhouse for sales today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see our work pay off (literally). Let\xe2\x80\x99s get into it!\\n\\nMy love of **Picross** has finally been reignited. The Switch games are on sale for like 8 bucks a piece right now so I picked a bunch of them up and, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s still Picross so it\xe2\x80\x99s still the GOAT puzzle game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a few before bed every night just to tucker my brain out and man, it\xe2\x80\x99s just such great stuff. Go buy a couple of the Picross S games on Switch while they\xe2\x80\x99re on sale because they\xe2\x80\x99re just so fucking fun.\\n\\nThe **Advance Wars** remakes are *amazing.* They feel now like how they felt in my child brain when I was a child. I\xe2\x80\x99m still not a *massive* fan of the artstyle changes because I still adore the original pixel art (and there\xe2\x80\x99s something weirdly uncanny about watching these pseudo-3D models sway back and forth) but it\xe2\x80\x99s still *really* great! It\xe2\x80\x99s still one of my favorite tactical RPGs of that era and I am going to continue praying every single day that, with the relative success of the Ogre Tactics remaster, Triangle Strategy, and the Advance Wars remake, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get FFT in some form. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a full remaster, just let me play FFT/FFTA/A2 again on modern consoles and I\xe2\x80\x99m in, guys.\\n\\nEvery new week of **Destiny** feels more and more like the game is disintegrating in front of my very eyes. What a mess. Still playing it because, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m 9 years deep and at a minimum, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see through what happens with the Final Shape, but after that\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bungie has at least one, maybe two new IPs in the cooker: Matter, which we know very little about beyond a couple of pieces of concept art and some job listings regarding a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter-based pvp game.\xe2\x80\x9d Rumors also abound that Bungie is working on some form of extraction shooter (for those unfamiliar with the term, think Tarkov). We also know Bungie was looking for devs to work on both an FPS and a Third-Person game\xe2\x80\xa6 so if I had to put money on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Matter is the third-person title and whatever this potential extraction shooter is would be your FPS title. But ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting either of those titles going forward, if only because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I particularly trust Bungie to put out well-balanced pvp-focused stuff anymore. While obviously Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is pretty unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Bungie was really ever known for their well-crafted competitive multiplayer experiences, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m also just not a big pvp-only gamer so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for me. We already know they plan to keep Destiny going past Final Shape without a Destiny 3 of sorts but like\xe2\x80\xa6 at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a major change. Dropping last-gen is going to have to occur at some point considering the tech debt that already exists within the game\xe2\x80\x99s myriad systems and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really do love this franchise with all my heart but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot at the moment. And I worry about the future of the franchise because, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s *still* nothing like it in the modern market. The Division 2 is great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not Destiny.\\n\\nOh, and **Honkai Star Rail** is out and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I expected it to be. I played absolutely *zero* of Genshin Impact, but I *did* play Honkai 3rd Impact and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly a direct sequel or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see some returning folks, like Seele and Bunny Bronya from H3i. Gameplay is relatively tight, definitely a little bit light on tactical strength but I\xe2\x80\x99m really early in. English VO work is preeeeetty solid although it suffers in the same way a lot of English VO work does in these sorts of things. The F!Trailblazer\xe2\x80\x99s design is *stellar* and her VO work is honestly very good as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mihoyo gacha, so I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating hating my life for drop rates (and at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s already sad, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled two actual characters in like thirty pulls with the pre-reg gifts), but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to putting some more time into it. Plays like shit on mobile though--runs fine, I just hate third-person movement control in my phone. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sticking to FGO and Octopath on mobile and playing HSR on PC.\\n\\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna start talking about wrasslin\xe2\x80\x99 on these post so apologies if you\xe2\x80\x99re not into that. **Dynamite** this week was just that. Orange Cassidy v. Bandido was an incredible opener, the two of them have great chemistry. The continuing questions about BCC v. The Elite and Takeshita is interesting, the Darby/Sammy match was great and getting a tag team next week will be interesting. Roddy Strong\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a *huge* surprise for me, I could not fucking believe it when I heard End of Heartache. Getting Cole/Strong/OC/Bandido v. JAS next week is a *weird* combo but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it if it means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting Cole back in the ring with Roddy Strong. Now we just need Bobby Fish to stop being a living meme and things will be great again. Meanwhile, **RAW** was mostly good, the segments with Sami and the Usos backstage were nice, although I\xe2\x80\x99d like that storyline to pick up. Cody/Balor was a weird match. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a whole hell of a lot about what happened on RAW. Draft is *tonight* though! We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting Jay White/Juice Robinson vs. Ricky Starks/Shawn Spears on Rampage tonight, which\xe2\x80\xa6 really stoked that we\xe2\x80\x99re already demoting White to Rampage, but whatever. He\xe2\x80\x99s still my boy. BREATHE.\\n\\nOther than that, pretty uneventful week for me. Dog had a bit of a health scare but he seems to be doing better in some capacity so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying about him all week. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting old, and we all know what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into when we get pets, but it still hurts when you think about them leaving. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to distract myself from it.

Also big news, we found out we\xe2\x80\x99re having a girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers. If Reaves/Hachimura continue to play solid and D\xe2\x80\x99Lo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shit the bed LeBron/AD is enough to power them through the field.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anxious Millennial Teacher"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlce/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Anxious Millennial Teacher","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654473,"updated_utc":1682654474,"body_sha1":"a3d7c43cf11e8115b9312d12386ed79c30cab5f7","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:00:58"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0gj","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"exmormon","author_flair_template_id":"fca9e4d2-3b8e-11e5-9781-0e37a0ef8875","id":"ji0hkq2","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zadok47","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_p1jzwkj7","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your child should NOT have a record card started when born.

This limits grain farmers who want to deal with CGC assurances to dealing with the big 6, CARGILL, VITERRA/g3, RICHARDSONS, PATERSONS, P&amp;H and ADM. not all six will be economically close to every farmer so you might have the option of 3 to work with\\n\\nNow the Canadian grain commission (CGC) regulates grain varieties in Canada so you have to grow a registered variety or your grain is basically considered feed grade(not always bad pricing) and these 6 companies own the rights to their own varieties\xe2\x80\xa6 they can\xe2\x80\x99t not buy grain from a farmer if it\xe2\x80\x99s a registered variety and meets grading requirements but they can make it difficult aaaaaaand they also own their own fertilizer/input companies so if you want to get a deal on inputs, you better be growing their product that they want you to grow.  When it comes to grain the only real bargain chip farmers have is storage till prices go up. But your bills are accumulating interest so you\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes just have to take whatever deals out there.\\n\\nNow on vegetables, your basically not going to grow them unless you have a guaranteed\\nContract from somewhere because storage isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually an option and your overhead is fucking unreal so there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe 3 distribution companies and 2 processors to deal with or your dealing directly with the grocery chain.

and cripple your onion business\xe2\x80\x9d they can only do that for a certain percent of the total to keep everybody happy the only way margin can be extracted is higher prices from the consumer who does in fact have to eat or lower prices to the farmer who needs cash flow to stay solvent.\\n\\nBasically an eat shit or get fucked situation unless you have a grower/buyer co-op with other farmers but that\xe2\x80\x99s communism /s\\n\\nAlso just remember when (generic crisis/shortage/whatever lie) the grocery chains are telling you is the reason prices are going up, those hardships and costs are dealt at the farm level and have no effect on the chain\xe2\x80\x99s operation except as a handy excuse to raise prices\\n\\n\\nThis is why I direct market to consumer or partner with independent

There\'s a semi-famous story about Morey going through the data for one of those Harden Rockets seasons and finding that \'random\', the name they gave for \'set a random screen or something idk\' was their most effective \'play\' by a mile.\\n\\nYou want players to have freedom to improvise, they\'re in the game they\'re reading the defenses, they have to make decisions in fractions of seconds.\\n\\nI think you can imagine it like the coach is providing both instructions and a cookbook for a team and telling them to cook for a party of ten. If that team is a great chef, then giving them some freedom is good - they can navigate the meal better by feel and reacting to what\'s happening - they know the shortcuts they can make and what needs done when. If the team is not such a good chef then maybe they need some stricter measurements, stricter timings. If you give them a list of recipes one team could get bogged down trying to decide, another might just really like an omelette and think that the party of ten will love just an omelette and another omelette and another omelette. One might not even need the book, they thrive with what they think would be good with what they have in front of them.\\n\\nThat\'s a very odd metaphor in hindsight, but it\'s just about mediation. If you are calling out a set every single possession then it\'s going to get old, the defense are going to catch on, and you\'re going to get messed up if something early in the process breaks down. That\'s why, I think, Budenholzer has his system. I think the problem is that for this Bucks roster freelancing is leading to a lot of poor shot selection, the off-ball reps don\'t happen because there\'s less often a purpose for it, and tired legs in the fourth (which get tired quickly because of an old roster) lead to bias toward the easiest option; the thought of watching someone iso is quietly more appealing when you\'re knackered.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Bucks2","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":mke-2:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/yng44hxzs4r81_t5_2qo4s/mke-2"},{"e":"text","t":" Bucks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1318nhi","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1318nhi/charania_mike_budenholzers_status_as_bucks_head/ji0h0jy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":mke-2: Bucks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654133,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"904f272bca517e92aef463f3b1ae36dd54a314f5","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_8aqc5g","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"OvertimeMeganNudes","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0hk","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Honest_Invite_3869","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9okj3vkt","all_awardings":[],"body":"https://discord.gg/TkZzusvV\\n\\nif these people had it for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d they would send the link in here, i got it for 3 bucks join the discord it says what to do","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1307xd9","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/OvertimeMeganNudes/comments/1307xd9/rovertimemegannudes_lounge/ji0h0hk/","subreddit_type":"restricted","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654132,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OvertimeMeganNudes","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"02bb3541bc8994d7cc8834c4b22a656109e5a69e","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:32"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_5m1dzu","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"rabbitsincolonies","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0fz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Nightshade_Ranch","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_bwifz8nm","all_awardings":[],"body":"Takes at least six weeks post neuter for the hormones to settle.

It was mostly just banter but I really did think the Celtics were going to wrap it up in 4 or 5 like everyone else.\\n\\nEven though you guys didn\'t win the series, the Hawks were extremely impressive particularly in these last 2 games where Trae buried us in game 5 and put us on notice and then you came out and it was a back and forth game up to the end. I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great.

He alone is worth double the panda energy company. That\'s the kind of money we are talking. Legitimate fuck you money.\\n\\nI recall the whole AEW thing being that TK is using his inheritance money (which is his not his dad\'s) to run the company. His dad wanted to see his kids  venture into their passions since he knew they were gonna spend the money anyways (Sure wish I had a dad like that lmao, if I had asked mine for twenty bucks he\'d be like \\"why you need ten dollars?\\").\\n\\nAnyways AEW probably isn\'t profitable rn I do agree with that, but I don\'t think it\'s haemorrhaging money nor is it in any financial troubles in the near future, that\'s what I am trying to say. Financially they\'ll be fine, we shouldn\'t care about their finances because we ain\'t financial experts, well unless you are in which case what should I invest in.

And now it is no longer Turd, not even Turd Ferguson, but [Mona.](https://imgur.com/a/luuzY42) Kind of a twist on a character of mine named Monika, which fits considering our last cat was Max. I\'ve never had a cat who loves being under the covers.\\n\\nWho are these characters you\'re talking about, you ask? Probably not but I\'ll do my spiel anyways! Please read [The Demon in Shadow!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-utFIYKm01e-xYdXfUMatPCuHeOfIICka2NZOJDpls/edit?usp=sharing) It\'s a full novel by myself about a human and demon who get caught up in each other\'s problems and become closer for it. It\'s set in an original world and made in such a way that you\'re learning about how things work alongside demon deuteragonist Ayun. And it\'s got amazing artwork in the back that I\'ve comissioned that gain more context when you read the thang ding.\\n\\nAfter last week\'s departure it\'s time to get back into the backlog. A kit that\'s been sitting in my stash for a while is [the Rune God Rayearth from the titular series Magic Knight Rayearth!](https://imgur.com/a/8NfVGAL) It\'s a pretty recent release from Goodsmile, syncing up nicely with them showing up in SRW 30... Even if they technically debuted in T. It doesn\'t have dual language, but it comes with a fully colored manual that is very good at pointing out how things need to be set in and work. It also has a good amount of pre-painted parts like the face and sword. Its articulation is a little stiff, which isn\'t helped by things like the skirt but I still think it looks great. Has enough hands to make fun poses and the flame effects on the wings are dope. Selece and Windam are waiting in the wings, so it will be great to have them all in one shot. \\n\\nSide note, the series is on Amazon Prime, dubbed and subbed? The dub isn\'t too bad, but the video quality is pretty bad. I guess it fits that 90s vibe? But I can\'t help but think there are much better transfers on the high seas. I mean, that Nadia one I found is GORGEOUS and that show came out five years prior to Rayearth. \\n\\nI was going to save this one for a rainy day, but neither this or the Rayearth shoots had a lot of content. And I was surprised that it wasn\'t a kit at all! I\'m talking about Joytoy\'s 40K figures! I got an [Imperial Fists Primaris Marine,](https://imgur.com/a/JWTVtzd) one of those early angry boys. I thought about going Space Wolves like the actual units I used to have somewhere, but this was part of a sale on USAG and the dogs were already sold out. For an action figure, this thing has a lot of good points going for it. Great articulation (except for one part we\'ll get to), good detailing, and even not on sale 40 bucks isn\'t bad at all. What does kill me about this thing are the hands. Not a lack of them, but the joints themselves. For some unknown reason, the wrists connect at two points. But the one that connects to the hand is super tight. To the point I had to bust out pliers in fear of dislodging a nail. And then fearing that trying to separate these pieces would just snap the joint altogether. Not fun. That\'s why there\'s a lot less shots, even though it comes with some cool hands. The other thing is that because of those beefy pauldrons, action poses aren\'t easy. Dynamic ones are perfect. Hold the gun up, rest the chainsword on your shoulder no problem. But aiming the gun might as well look like a Gundam kit from the 80s. You can remove the shoulders, but it doesn\'t really fix that problem. I think if they get rid of the stupid hand garbage it would be an easy recommendation from me. But as it stands, maybe get one you like and never change their weapons.\\n\\nI fell back into Fallout 4 for a minute, but I feel like even with some good mods I had scraped that rock clean. More than clean, considering Steam says I have 2,360 hours in the game. But rather than go back to 3 or New Vegas, I pulled the trigger on a purchase I made back when it was on single-digit sale. Yep, 76. The crazy thing is... I\'m enjoying it? It\'s definitely not the garbage show I remember seeing videos about. The loop is very similar to 4, but with little changes that make things interesting to me. It helps that I\'m keeping ahead of myself to play for my own sake. None of that FOMO stuff, if a daily challenge thing is interesting or something I was already going to do, sure. Otherwise, play for exploring/the story(?) and stop when I\'m bored or feel like it\'s a slog. And so far, it\'s been really good. I like how they shuffled certain materials around so that your goals change. Other than maybe adhesive, you\'re never really just going \\"need this thing\\" forever.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Dub Sympathizer"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hukv/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Dub Sympathizer","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654606,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654619,"updated_utc":1682654620,"body_sha1":"754307ef385ab8cb28e89aeed9c80d92de11c390","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:03:26"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qo4s","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"nba","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0htpt","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zealousideal-Reach36","send_replies":true,"parent_id":42447955745,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_84sntr8y","all_awardings":[],"body":"Yea, the bucks literally failed to meet the expectations of a number 1 seed.

Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to be a full remaster, just let me play FFT/FFTA/A2 again on modern consoles and I\xe2\x80\x99m in, guys.\\n\\nEvery new week of **Destiny** feels more and more like the game is disintegrating in front of my very eyes. What a mess. Still playing it because, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m 9 years deep and at a minimum, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see through what happens with the Final Shape, but after that\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bungie has at least one, maybe two new IPs in the cooker: Matter, which we know very little about beyond a couple of pieces of concept art and some job listings regarding a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter-based pvp game.\xe2\x80\x9d Rumors also abound that Bungie is working on some form of extraction shooter (for those unfamiliar with the term, think Tarkov). We also know Bungie was looking for devs to work on both an FPS and a Third-Person game\xe2\x80\xa6 so if I had to put money on it, I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Matter is the third-person title and whatever this potential extraction shooter is would be your FPS title. But ultimately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting either of those titles going forward, if only because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I particularly trust Bungie to put out well-balanced pvp-focused stuff anymore. While obviously Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is pretty unique, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Bungie was really ever known for their well-crafted competitive multiplayer experiences, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m also just not a big pvp-only gamer so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for me. We already know they plan to keep Destiny going past Final Shape without a Destiny 3 of sorts but like\xe2\x80\xa6 at some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a major change. Dropping last-gen is going to have to occur at some point considering the tech debt that already exists within the game\xe2\x80\x99s myriad systems and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really do love this franchise with all my heart but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good spot at the moment. And I worry about the future of the franchise because, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s *still* nothing like it in the modern market. The Division 2 is great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not Destiny.\\n\\nOh, and **Honkai Star Rail** is out and it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I expected it to be. I played absolutely *zero* of Genshin Impact, but I *did* play Honkai 3rd Impact and while this isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly a direct sequel or anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see some returning folks, like Seele and Bunny Bronya from H3i. Gameplay is relatively tight, definitely a little bit light on tactical strength but I\xe2\x80\x99m really early in. English VO work is preeeeetty solid although it suffers in the same way a lot of English VO work does in these sorts of things. The F!Trailblazer\xe2\x80\x99s design is *stellar* and her VO work is honestly very good as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mihoyo gacha, so I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating hating my life for drop rates (and at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s already sad, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled two actual characters in like thirty pulls with the pre-reg gifts), but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to putting some more time into it. Plays like shit on mobile though--runs fine, I just hate third-person movement control in my phone. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sticking to FGO and Octopath on mobile and playing HSR on PC.\\n\\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna start talking about wrasslin\xe2\x80\x99 on these post so apologies if you\xe2\x80\x99re not into that. **Dynamite** this week was just that. Orange Cassidy v. Bandido was an incredible opener, the two of them have great chemistry. The continuing questions about BCC v. The Elite and Takeshita is interesting, the Darby/Sammy match was great and getting a tag team next week will be interesting. Roddy Strong\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a *huge* surprise for me, I could not fucking believe it when I heard End of Heartache. Getting Cole/Strong/OC/Bandido v. JAS next week is a *weird* combo but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it if it means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting Cole back in the ring with Roddy Strong. Now we just need Bobby Fish to stop being a living meme and things will be great again. Meanwhile, **RAW** was mostly good, the segments with Sami and the Usos backstage were nice, although I\xe2\x80\x99d like that storyline to pick up. Cody/Balor was a weird match. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a whole hell of a lot about what happened on RAW. Draft is *tonight* though! We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting Jay White/Juice Robinson vs. Ricky Starks/Shawn Spears on Rampage tonight, which\xe2\x80\xa6 really stoked that we\xe2\x80\x99re already demoting White to Rampage, but whatever. He\xe2\x80\x99s still my boy. BREATHE.\\n\\nOther than that, pretty uneventful week for me. Dog had a bit of a health scare but he seems to be doing better in some capacity so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying about him all week. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting old, and we all know what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into when we get pets, but it still hurts when you think about them leaving. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to distract myself from it. Hope everyone\xe2\x80\x99s week was good!\\n\\n-----\\n\\n2023 Games Completed Count: 16\\n\\n[My HLTB Archive](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/waycarer/games)","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"wat","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Resident Atelier Stan"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlsc/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Resident Atelier Stan","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654465,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654480,"updated_utc":1682654481,"body_sha1":"4fba5371d48b2a62bc3329c4e03a41761b0fee89","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:01:05"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2uzei","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"TwoBestFriendsPlay","author_flair_template_id":"a6985eb8-24dd-11e2-84d6-12313b0c247a","id":"ji0hlce","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"PomfAndCircvmstance","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_fdxvc","all_awardings":[],"body":"**Babby Quest** I\xe2\x80\x99m tired all the time but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m getting less nauseous.

I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed because all the people trying to speak it into existence have been super smug about it but also it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a daughter and a son. I kinda know what I want to call her but I\xe2\x80\x99m open to suggestions, the dumber the better.\\n\\n**Stellaris** Bloodborne takes a break this week as I\xe2\x80\x99m still salty over Laurence and Chalice Dungeon Rom (seriously what the goddamn fuck is with Chalice Dungeon Rom!? Who is the sadistic psychopath that thought that taking the worst, most annoying boss in the game and sticking it in a room the size of a supply closet was a good idea?). Instead. I hopped back into Stellaris to mess around more with the new First Contact DLC. I love the flavor and bonuses that observing Primitives provides. They\xe2\x80\x99re like a little virtual ant farm that occasionally nukes themselves into extinction. In my current game I\xe2\x80\x99m observing a primitive hivemind slowly develop empathy while consuming a planet\xe2\x80\x99s entire ecosystem.\\n\\nAlso new DLC coming right around the corner already? Internal politics? Making leaders more than just the forgettable, replaceable parts that I treat them as? All of the yes. My goofy RP loving self is loving what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. Still crazy that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting two DLC drops in two months.\\n\\n**SPORTS SPORTS SPORTS** Sports. The local hockey team (Vegas) is about to win in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about hockey but I will absolutely act insufferable online about my local team winning. Get fucked Winnipeg. We\xe2\x80\x99re better at hockey than Canada is.\\n\\nNBA playoffs are also rolling. The first round has been wild. The Bucks getting embarrassed by an 8th seed is wild, even if that 8th seed has Jimmy \xe2\x80\x9cBeat the Starters With 3rd Stringers\xe2\x80\x9d Butler leading them. Coach Bud needs to be fired into the Sun for the horrific coaching job hes done this series. The Clippers are forever fucked. Kawhi and Paul George will never be healthy at the same time. This roster is so talented and Ty Lue\xe2\x80\x99s a great coach but their stars are made of paper. The Knicks are forreal. Call me crazy but I think this team is going to the Finals. They\xe2\x80\x99re better than the Heat and they own the Celtics this year. If the Celtics beat the 76ers like they usually do then the Knicks have a very winnable path to the Finals. The West is super wide open. Every team left standing has the tools to win it all but at least one or two brutal weaknesses that could hold them back. For my money I\xe2\x80\x99m taking LeBron and the Lakers. If Reaves/Hachimura continue to play solid and D\xe2\x80\x99Lo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shit the bed LeBron/AD is enough to power them through the field.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anxious Millennial Teacher"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_131gy2y","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/131gy2y/free_talk_friday_april_28_2023/ji0hlce/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Anxious Millennial Teacher","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654458,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/TwoBestFriendsPlay","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654473,"updated_utc":1682654474,"body_sha1":"a3d7c43cf11e8115b9312d12386ed79c30cab5f7","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 04:00:58"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0gj","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"richtext","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"exmormon","author_flair_template_id":"fca9e4d2-3b8e-11e5-9781-0e37a0ef8875","id":"ji0hkq2","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Zadok47","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_p1jzwkj7","all_awardings":[],"body":"Your child should NOT have a record card started when born.

When it comes to grain the only real bargain chip farmers have is storage till prices go up. But your bills are accumulating interest so you\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes just have to take whatever deals out there.\\n\\nNow on vegetables, your basically not going to grow them unless you have a guaranteed\\nContract from somewhere because storage isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually an option and your overhead is fucking unreal so there\xe2\x80\x99s maybe 3 distribution companies and 2 processors to deal with or your dealing directly with the grocery chain.

There\'s a semi-famous story about Morey going through the data for one of those Harden Rockets seasons and finding that \'random\', the name they gave for \'set a random screen or something idk\' was their most effective \'play\' by a mile.\\n\\nYou want players to have freedom to improvise, they\'re in the game they\'re reading the defenses, they have to make decisions in fractions of seconds.\\n\\nI think you can imagine it like the coach is providing both instructions and a cookbook for a team and telling them to cook for a party of ten. If that team is a great chef, then giving them some freedom is good - they can navigate the meal better by feel and reacting to what\'s happening - they know the shortcuts they can make and what needs done when. If the team is not such a good chef then maybe they need some stricter measurements, stricter timings. If you give them a list of recipes one team could get bogged down trying to decide, another might just really like an omelette and think that the party of ten will love just an omelette and another omelette and another omelette. One might not even need the book, they thrive with what they think would be good with what they have in front of them.\\n\\nThat\'s a very odd metaphor in hindsight, but it\'s just about mediation. If you are calling out a set every single possession then it\'s going to get old, the defense are going to catch on, and you\'re going to get messed up if something early in the process breaks down. That\'s why, I think, Budenholzer has his system. I think the problem is that for this Bucks roster freelancing is leading to a lot of poor shot selection, the off-ball reps don\'t happen because there\'s less often a purpose for it, and tired legs in the fourth (which get tired quickly because of an old roster) lead to bias toward the easiest option; the thought of watching someone iso is quietly more appealing when you\'re knackered.","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":"Bucks2","author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[{"a":":mke-2:","e":"emoji","u":"https://emoji.redditmedia.com/yng44hxzs4r81_t5_2qo4s/mke-2"},{"e":"text","t":" Bucks"}],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":true,"can_gild":true,"link_id":"t3_1318nhi","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":true,"permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1318nhi/charania_mike_budenholzers_status_as_bucks_head/ji0h0jy/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"author_flair_text":":mke-2: Bucks","treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654133,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nba","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"904f272bca517e92aef463f3b1ae36dd54a314f5","utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:33"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_8aqc5g","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"OvertimeMeganNudes","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0hk","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Honest_Invite_3869","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_9okj3vkt","all_awardings":[],"body":"https://discord.gg/TkZzusvV\\n\\nif these people had it for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d they would send the link in here, i got it for 3 bucks join the discord it says what to do","top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"is_submitter":false,"gildings":{},"collapsed_reason":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":false,"link_id":"t3_1307xd9","unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/OvertimeMeganNudes/comments/1307xd9/rovertimemegannudes_lounge/ji0h0hk/","subreddit_type":"restricted","locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"created_utc":1682654132,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/OvertimeMeganNudes","controversiality":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_utc":1682654144,"updated_utc":1682654145,"body_sha1":"02bb3541bc8994d7cc8834c4b22a656109e5a69e","nest_level":1,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-28 03:55:32"},{"subreddit_id":"t5_5m1dzu","author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"edited":false,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"rabbitsincolonies","author_flair_template_id":null,"id":"ji0h0fz","gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"Nightshade_Ranch","send_replies":true,"parent_id":null,"score":1,"author_fullname":"t2_bwifz8nm","all_awardings":[],"body":"Takes at least six weeks post neuter for the hormones to settle.

I think if this went to a game 7 it would have been similar to this game 6 where it would go down to the last 2 minutes. I was dreading suffering the same fate as the Bucks this year or like what you did to the Sixers in 2021. You guys fought hard and I think that\'s more than a lot of other people were expecting. Having to fight that hard for every single rebound was so aggravating as a fan, Capela and Okongwu were huge for you guys. It was like watching Looney and Wiggins grab every board from the finals just crushing any hope of second chance points and shrinking the margin for error.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to catch every single game of basketball so I just watch the Celtics and don\'t necessarily watch enough to appreciate other team\'s players as much, but Trae is truly great.
